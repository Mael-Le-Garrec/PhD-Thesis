	title = {Error analysis of linear optics measurements via turn-by-turn beam position data in circular accelerators},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00281},
	abstract = {Many advanced techniques have been developed, tested and implemented in the last decades in almost all circular accelerators across the world to measure the linear optics. However, the greater availability and accuracy of beam diagnostics and the ever better correction of linear magnetic lattice imperfections (beta beating at 1\% level and coupling at 0.1\%) are reaching what seems to be the intrinsic accuracy and precision of different measurement techniques. This paper aims to highlight and quantify, when possible, the limitations of one standard method, the harmonic analysis of turn-by-turn beam position data. To this end, new analytic formulas for the evaluation of lattice parameters modified by focusing errors are derived. The unexpected conclusion of this study is that for the ESRF storage ring (and possibly for any third generation light source operating at ultra-low coupling and with similar diagnostics), measurement and correction of linear optics via orbit beam position data are to be preferred to the analysis of turn-by-turn data.},

	abstract = {Since 2015 the LHC has been operating at 6.5 TeV. In 2016 the β-functions at the interaction points of ATLAS and CMS were squeezed to 0.4 m. This is below the design β∗=0.55 m at 7 TeV, and has been instrumental to surpass the design luminosity of 1034 cm−2 s−1. Achieving a lower than nominal β∗ has been possible thanks to the extraordinary performance of the LHC, in which the control of the optics has played a fundamental role. Even though the β-beating for the virgin machine was above 100\%, corrections reduced the rms β-beating below 1\% at the two main experiments and below 2\% rms around the ring. This guarantees a safe operation as well as providing equal amount of luminosity for the two experiments. In this article we describe the recent improvements to the measurement, correction algorithms and technical equipment which allowed this unprecedented control of the optics for a high-energy hadron collider.},

	abstract = {Modern particle accelerators have tight tolerances on the acceptable deviation from their desired machine parameters. The control of the parameters is of crucial importance for safe machine operation and performance. This thesis focuses on beam-based methods and algorithms to identify and correct errors in particle accelerators. The optics measurements and corrections of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which resulted in an unprecedented low β-beat for a hadron collider is described. The transverse coupling is another parameter which is of importance to control. Improvement in the reconstruction of the coupling from turn-by-turn data has resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease of the measurement uncertainty. An automatic coupling correction method, which is based on the injected beam oscillations, has been successfully used in normal operation of the LHC. Furthermore, a new method to measure and correct chromatic coupling that was applied to the LHC, is described. It resulted in a decrease of the chromatic coupling by a factor ∼2 for both beams. The good control of the optics is a signiﬁcant part of the success of the LHC and hence contributed to the discovery of the Higgs particle.},

This study covers a highest-luminosity high-energy lepton collider (FCC-ee) and an energy-frontier hadron collider (FCC-hh), which could, successively, be installed in the same 100 km tunnel. The scientific capabilities of the integrated FCC programme would serve the worldwide community throughout the 21st century. The FCC study also investigates an LHC energy upgrade, using FCC-hh technology. This document constitutes the second volume of the FCC Conceptual Design Report, devoted to the electron-positron collider FCC-ee. After summarizing the physics discovery opportunities, it presents the accelerator design, performance reach, a staged operation scenario, the underlying technologies, civil engineering, technical infrastructure, and an implementation plan. FCC-ee can be built with today's technology. Most of the FCC-ee infrastructure could be reused for FCC-hh. Combining concepts from past and present lepton colliders and adding a few novel elements, the FCC-ee design promises outstandingly high luminosity. This will make the FCC-ee a unique precision instrument to study the heaviest known particles (Z, W and H bosons and the top quark), offering great direct and indirect sensitivity to new physics.},

	abstract = {In response to the 2013 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics (EPPSU), the Future Circular Collider (FCC) study was launched as a world-wide international collaboration hosted by CERN. The FCC study covered an energy-frontier hadron collider (FCC-hh), a highest-luminosity high-energy lepton collider (FCC-ee), the corresponding 100 km tunnel infrastructure, as well as the physics opportunities of these two colliders, and a high-energy LHC, based on FCC-hh technology. This document constitutes the third volume of the FCC Conceptual Design Report, devoted to the hadron collider FCC-hh. It summarizes the FCC-hh physics discovery opportunities, presents the FCC-hh accelerator design, performance reach, and staged operation plan, discusses the underlying technologies, the civil engineering and technical infrastructure, and also sketches a possible implementation. Combining ingredients from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the high-luminosity LHC upgrade and adding novel technologies and approaches, the FCC-hh design aims at significantly extending the energy frontier to 100 TeV. Its unprecedented centre of-mass collision energy will make the FCC-hh a unique instrument to explore physics beyond the Standard Model, offering great direct sensitivity to new physics and discoveries.},

	abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the largest scientific instruments ever built. Since opening up anew energy frontier for exploration in 2010, it has gathered a global user community of about 9000 scientists working in fundamental particle physics and the physics of hadronic matter at extreme temperature and density. To sustain and extend its discovery potential, the LHC will need a major upgrade in the 2020s. This will increase its instantaneous luminosity (rate of collisions) by a factor of five beyond the original design valueand the integrated luminosity (totalnumber of collisions) by a factor ten. The LHC is already a highly complexand exquisitely optimised machine so this upgrade must be carefully conceived and will require new infrastructures(underground and on surface)and over a decade to implement. The new configuration, known as High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), relies on a number of key innovations that push accelerator technology beyond its present limits. Among these are cutting-edge 11– 12Tesla superconducting magnets, compact superconducting cavities for beam rotation with ultra-precise phase control, new technology and physical processes for beam collimation and 100 metre-long high-power superconducting links with negligible energy dissipation, all of which required several years of dedicated R\&D; effort on a global international level. The present document describes the technologies and components that will be used to realise the projectand is intended to serve as the basis for the detailed engineering design of the HL-LHC.},

Improved accelerating structures, potentially using new materials or plasma-based colliders might nevertheless be a very cost-effective path to much higher collision energies, even within a relatively compact linear collider facility. At these higher energies ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde 10 TeV or above), a linear collider would also face a power consumption or luminosity challenge.

	abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the largest scientific instruments ever built. Since opening up a new energy frontier for exploration in 2010, it has gathered a global user community working in fundamental particle physics and the physics of hadronic matter at extreme temperature and density. To sustain and extend its discovery potential, the LHC will undergo a major upgrade in the 2020s. This will increase its rate of collisions by a factor of five beyond the original design value and the integrated luminosity by a factor ten. The new configuration, known as High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), will rely on a number of key innovations that push accelerator technology beyond its present limits. Among these are cutting-edge 11– 12 T superconducting magnets, including Nb 3 Sn-based magnets never used in accelerators before, compact superconducting cavities for longitudinal beam rotation, new technology and physical processes for beam collimation. The dynamics of the HL-LHC beams will be also particularly challenging and this aspect is the main focus of this paper.},

We take the ac dipole frequency to be 1.0\% of the revolution frequency away from the betatron frequency. To achieve the strong magnetic field with minimum power loss, an air-core magnet with two seven turn winding of low loss Litz wire resonating at 64 kHz is designed. The system is also designed to allow one to connect the two magnet winding in series to resonate at 37 kHz for the spin manipulation.

For the HL-LHC the larger crossing angle together with a smaller beta function at the collision point would result in more than 70\% luminosity loss due to the incomplete geometric overlap of colliding bunches. To recover head-on collisions at the high-luminosity particle-physics detectors ATLAS and CMS and benefit from the very low \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ provided by the Achromatic Telescopic Squeezing (ATS) optics, a local crab cavity scheme provides transverse kicks to the proton bunches. The tight space constraints at the location of these cavities leads to designs which are axially non-symmetric, giving rise to high order multipoles components of the main deflecting mode and, since these kicks are harmonic in time, we expand them in a series of multipoles in a similar fashion as is done for static field magnets. In this work we calculate, for the first time, the higher order multipoles and their impact on beam dynamics for three different crab cavity prototypes. Different approaches to calculate the multipoles are presented. Furthermore, we perform the first calculation of their impact on the long term stability of the machine using the concept of dynamic aperture.},

Yet for many observables in particle physics, perturbative techniques are sufficient to accurately model all but a constrained range of energies within the validity of the theory. We demonstrate that effective field theories (EFTs) provide an efficient mechanism to separate the high energy dynamics that is easily calculated by traditional perturbation theory from the dynamics at low energy and show how quantum algorithms can be used to simulate the dynamics of the low energy EFT from first principles. As an explicit example we calculate the expectation values of vacuum-to-vacuum and vacuum-to-one-particle transitions in the presence of a time-ordered product of two Wilson lines in scalar field theory, an object closely related to those arising in EFTs of the Standard Model of particle physics. Calculations are performed using simulations of a quantum computer as well as measurements using the IBMQ Manhattan machine.},

The motivation arises in the possibility of finding a method to reliably extrapolate the results of numerical simulations well beyond what is currently possible in terms of CPU time. In earlier work, a proposal for a model based on Nekhoroshev theorem and Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theory was made. This model has been studied in detail and proved successful in describing the evolution of the dynamic aperture in numerical simulations, however, a number of shortcomings had been identified and new models are proposed in this paper, which solve the observed issues. The new models have been benchmarked against numerical simulations for a simple system, the 4D H{\textbackslash}textbackslash 'enon map, as well as a realistic, non-linear representation of the beam dynamics in the LHC at 6.5 TeV providing in both cases excellent results.},

	abstract = {The high luminosity requirement for a future linear collider sets a demanding limit on the beam quality at the Interaction Point (IP). One potential source of luminosity loss is the motion of the ground itself. The resulting misalignments of the quadrupole magnets cause distortions to the beam orbit and hence an increase in the beam emittance. This paper describes a technique for compensating this orbit distortion by using seismometers to monitor the misalignment of the quadrupole magnets in real-time. The first demonstration of the technique was achieved at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at KEK in Japan. The feed-forward system consisted of a seismometer-based quadrupole motion monitoring system, an FPGA-based feed-forward processor and a stripline kicker plus associated electronics. Through the application of a kick calculated from the position of a single quadruple, the system was able to remove about 80\% of the component of the beam jitter that was correlated to the motion of the quadrupole. As a significant fraction of the orbit jitter in the ATF final focus is due to sources other than quadrupole misalignment, this amounted to an approximately 15\% reduction in the absolute beam jitter.},

The theory of the Oide effect was derived considering only the second moment of the radiation in the focusing plane of the magnet. This article addresses the theoretical calculation of the radiation effect on the beam size considering the first and second moments of the radiation and both focusing and defocusing planes of the quadrupole. The effect for a Gaussian beam is referred to as 2D-Oide; however, an alternative beam size figure is given that could represent better the effect on the minimum achievable \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$y. The CLIC 3 TeV final quadrupole (QD0) and beam parameters are used to compare the theoretical results from the Oide effect and the 2D-Oide effect with particle tracking in placet. The 2D-Oide effect is demonstrated to be important, as it increases by 17\% the contribution to the beam size. Further insight into the aberrations induced by the synchrotron radiation opens the possibility to partially correct the 2D-Oide effect with octupole magnets. A beam size reduction of 4\% is achieved in the simplest configuration, using a single octupole.},

	url = {http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/261302},
	abstract = {The CHEASE code, which has been developed at the Swiss Plasma Center, generates an accurate reconstruction of toroidal magnetohydrodynamics equilibria by numerically solving the Grad-Shafranov equation. Having demonstrated its ability to achieve good convergence while remaining fast and very flexible, this code is now extensively used at different research facilities. From two input profiles, usually the pressure and the current density as well as specified boundary conditions, the code provides a complete equilibrium description which is essential for the study of tokamak plasmas. This project focuses on computing axisymmetric equilibria within ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by imposing a specific shape for the safety factor \$q\$. The Grad-Shafranov equation requires two free functions to be specified: one for the current density and one for the pressure (p=nT). Until now, the options in CHEASE allowed to give the pressure profile or its derivative on one hand and either \$TT'\$, \$I{\textasciicircum}*\$, \$I\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash parallel\}\$, or \$J\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslash parallel\}\$ on the other hand. The safety factor profile was therefore a result of the computation of the equilibrium. However, this profile and its radial derivative are essential for stability and transport issues into the tokamak. The goal of the present project is thus to modify the code so as to be able to provide a safety factor profile as a CHEASE input. However, equilibria generated with the safety factor profile as input can easily lead to surface currents if strong variation of the derivative \${\textbackslash}textbackslash frac\{dq\}\{d{\textbackslash}textbackslash rho\}\$ appears in the solution. It is therefore necessary to develop a method to avoid these problems, especially at the edge of the plasma. A further aim of this work is hence to demonstrate that there is no continuity problem within solutions computed with a q-profile as input. There are two ways of achieving this: one is to impose the current profile within one iteration to obtain the desired safety factor profile and the other is to impose the \$TT'\$ profile in the same way. The two solutions are explored in this project with the purpose to determine which one is most appropriate. Finally, the extended version of CHEASE developed in this master project is used to study the influence of safety factor profiles on the stability of tearing modes by solving the energy principle equation within the cylindrical approximation which depends directly on \$q\$, \$q'\$ and \$q”\$},

This overview outlines the systems measuring the tune, chromaticity and betatron coupling of the LHC beams, referred to in the paper as the transverse diagnostic systems. As manual correction of the parameters may reach its limit with respect to required precision and expected time scales, the LHC is the first proton collider that can be safely and reliably operated only with automatic feedback systems for controlling transverse beam dynamics.

Field values given on the boundary of the region of interest are reproduced inside by an arrangement of hypothetical magnetic or electric monopoles surrounding the boundary surface. The vector and scalar potentials are obtained by summing the contributions of each monopole. The second step of the method improves the evaluation speed of the potentials and their derivatives by orders of magnitude. This comprises covering the region of interest by overlapping spheres, then calculating the spherical harmonic expansion of the potentials on each sphere. During tracking, field values are evaluated by calculating the solid harmonics and their derivatives inside a sphere containing the particle. Software has been developed to test and demonstrate the method on a small particle accelerator. To our knowledge, there is no other method of this kind, allowing long time symplectic integration in general static fields, without simplification.},

	abstract = {Magnets are at the core of both circular and linear accelerators. The main function of a magnet is to guide the charged particle beam by virtue of the Lorentz force, given by the following expression:where q is the electrical charge of the particle, v its velocity, and B the magnetic field induction. The trajectory of a particle in the field depends hence on the particle velocity and on the space distribution of the field. The simplest case is that of a uniform magnetic field with a single component and velocity v normal to it, in which case the particle trajectory is a circle. A uniform field has thus a pure bending effect on a charged particle, and the magnet that generates it is generally referred to as a dipole.},

In this paper, under similar but more restrictive conditions, we show that a modified version of the power method converges to the global optimum. This is simpler and (empirically) faster than convex approaches. Empirically, they both succeed in the same regime. Further analysis shows that, in the same noise regime as previously studied, secondorder necessary optimality conditions for this quadratically constrained quadratic program are also sufficient, despite nonconvexity.},

In this article, we present two different models for the evolution of the beam parameters and the luminosity in heavy-ion colliders. The first, Collider Time Evolution is a particle tracking code, while the second, the Multi-Bunch Simulation is based on the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations for beam parameters. As a benchmark, we compare simulations and data for a large number of physics fills in the 2018 Pb– Pb run at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), finding excellent agreement for most parameters, both between the simulations and with the measured data. Both codes are then used independently to predict the performance in future heavy-ion operation, with both Pb– Pb and p– Pb collisions, at the LHC and its upgrade, the high-luminosity LHC. The use of two independent codes based on different principles gives increased confidence in the results.},

These interactions can arise from the unavoidable presence of residual gas in the accelerator vacuum chamber, or from the impact of particles lost from the beam on aperture limits around the accelerator, as well as the final beam dump. The wanted collisions of the beams in a collider to produce potentially interesting High Energy Physics events also reduces the density of the circulating beam and can produce high fluxes of secondary particles.},

	abstract = {The Large Hadron electron Collider, LHeC, is the means to move deep inelastic physics following HERA to the energy frontier of particle physics as it is being exploited by the HL-LHC. The paper presents a thorough update of the initial LHeC Conceptual Design Report (CDR) published in 2012. It comprises new results on the far reaching physics programme on parton structure, QCD dynamics, electroweak and top physics. It is shown how LHeC will open a new chapter of nuclear particle physics by extending the kinematic range in lepton-nucleus scattering by several orders of magnitude. Owing to an enhanced luminosity goal, the high centre of mass energy and the cleanliness of the neutral and charged current final states, the LHeC has a very remarkable Higgs programme and a promising potential to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. The design is for concurrent LHeC and HL-LHC operation which paves the way for transforming the LHC in its final phase of operation to a high precision Higgs and electroweak physics facility with also a much increased range to explore new physics up to 100 TeV mass, as is demonstrated in a separate chapter. Building on the CDR, the paper presents a detailed updated design of the energy recovery electron linac (ERL) including new lattice, magnet, SRF technology and interaction region designs. A lower energy, high current ERL facility, PERLE at Orsay, is described which uses the basic LHeC configuration parameters, a 3-turn racetrack, the source, and cryo-module designs, enabling it to serve as a development facility assisting the design and anticipated operation of the LHeC. The electron accelerator frequency is now chosen to be \$801.58\${\textbackslash}textbackslash,MHz and the first 5-cell Niobium cavity is presented which has reached a \$Q\_0\$ of \$3 {\textbackslash}textbackslash cdot 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ exceeding the design goal. An updated detector design, including a forward hadron tagger, is presented as a base for the acceptance, resolution and calibration goals which arise from the Higgs and PDF physics programme. The detector is shown to require an installation time of two years which is commensurate with typical LHC shutdown durations. The paper comprises a brief report of the LHeC international advisory committee with recommendations on the next steps to be made in preparing the possible endorsement of the LHeC as part of the LHC project. While the paper is dedicated to the LHeC, it also presents novel results on the FCC-eh which is designed to utilise the same ERL technology, or a relocated LHeC depending on future developments of the energy frontier collider landscape},

	url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/2229595},
	abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the biggest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world, designed to collide two proton beams with particle momentum of 7 TeV/c each. The stored energy of 362MJ in each beam is sufficient to melt 500 kg of copper or to evaporate about 300 liter of water. An accidental release of even a small fraction of the beam energy can cause severe damage to accelerator equipment. Reliable machine protection systems are necessary to safely operate the accelerator complex. To design a machine protection system, it is essential to know the damage potential of the stored beam and the consequences in case of a failure. One (catastrophic) failure would be, if the entire beam is lost in the aperture due to a problem with the beam dumping system. This thesis presents the simulation studies, results of a benchmarking experiment, and detailed target investigation, for this failure case. In the experiment, solid copper cylinders were irradiated with the 440GeV proton beam delivered by the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at the High Radiation to Materials (HiRadMat) facility at CERN. The experiment confirmed the existence of the so-called hydrodynamic tunneling phenomenon for the first time. Detailed numerical simulations for particle-matter interaction with FLUKA, and with the two-dimensional hydrodynamic code, BIG2, were carried out. Excellent agreement was found between the experimental and the simulation results that validate predictions for the 7TeV beam of the LHC. The hydrodynamic tunneling effect is of considerable importance for the design of machine protection systems for accelerators with high stored beam energy. In addition, this thesis presents the first studies of the damage potential with beam parameters of the Future Circular Collider (FCC). To detect beam losses due to fast failures it is essential to have fast beam instrumentation. Diamond based particle detectors are able to detect beam losses within a nanosecond time scale. Specially designed diamond detectors were used in the experiment mentioned above. Their efficiency and response has been studied for the first time over 5 orders of bunch intensity with electrons at the Beam Test Facility (BTF) at INFN, Frascati, Italy. The results of these measurements are discussed in this thesis. Furthermore an overview of the applications of diamond based particle detectors in damage experiments and for LHC operation is presented.},

	abstract = {For a single hadron bunch in a circular accelerator at zero chromaticity, without multi-turn wakes and without electron clouds and other beams, only one transverse collective instability is possible, the mode-coupling instability, or TMCI. For sufficiently strong space charge (SC), the instability threshold of the wake-driven coherent tune shift normally increases linearly with the SC tune shift, as independently concluded by several authors using different methods. This stability condition has, however, a very strange feature: at strong SC, it is totally insensitive to the number of particles. Thus, were it correct, such a beam with sufficiently strong SC, being stable at some intensity, would remain stable at higher intensity, regardless of how much higher! This paper suggests a resolution of this conundrum: while SC suppresses TMCI, it introduces head-to-tail convective amplifications, which could make the beam even less stable than without SC, even if all the coherent tunes are real, i.e. all the modes are stable in the conventional \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash it absolute\} meaning of the word. This is done using an effective new method of analysis of the beam's transverse spectrum for arbitrary space charge and wake fields. Two new types of beam instabilities are introduced: the \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash it saturating convective instability\}, SCI, and the \{{\textbackslash}textbackslash it absolute-convective instability\}, ACI.},

We introduce deep Lie map networks, which enable construction of an accelerator model including multipole components for the magnetic field errors by linking charged particle dynamics with machine learning methodology in a data-driven approach. Based on simulated beam-position-monitor readings for the example case of SIS18 at GSI, we demonstrate inference of location and strengths of gradient and sextupole errors for all accelerator sections in parallel.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05836},
	abstract = {Corrections of gradient errors in the interactions regions (IRs) of high energy colliders have traditionally been made by changing the strengths of quadrupoles that are common to both beams, such as the triplet quadrupoles. This article shows that magnetic errors in the IR quadrupoles that are no common to both beams, such as the matching quadrupoles, can have an important influence and, therefore, the correction should also include these quadrupoles. A correction based on twelve IR quadrupoles (common and no common) is presented and validated through MADX simulations. To estimate the strengths of this correction, the action and phase in the inter-triplet space, the space that separates the two triplets of the IR, are required. A novel method to estimate these quantities is also presented. The main sources of uncertainties in this novel method are identified and compared to the current method that uses two beam position monitor within the inter-triplet space. Finally, LHC experimental data is used to estimate the strengths of a twelve-quadrupole correction in the interaction region 1 of the LHC. The resulting correction is compared with a six-quadrupole correction estimated with another method called segment-by-segment (SBS).},

This paper highlights the challenge of high precision tune measurements (down to 10-5) for the correct determination of \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ in the high luminosity LHC.

Limitations of traditional excitation methods at top energy, in particular due to machine protection, have pushed the development of safe alternative methods using ac dipoles to characterize the nonlinear content of the LHC. One of the methods that has been proposed is the dynamic aperture under forced oscillation of ac dipoles. This new observable has the potential to help characterize relative changes in the nonlinear content of the machine, improve the understanding of the nonlinear models by comparing to simulations, validate nonlinear optics corrections, and give a qualitative lower bound estimate on the free dynamic aperture. This paper presents the first experimental demonstration of forced dynamic aperture measurements under forced oscillations performed using the LHC ac dipoles, and discusses the benefits of forced dynamic aperture measurements in circular colliders.},

Based on this model, we propose a novel fast-simulation workflow that starts from a large amount of generator-level events to deliver large analysis-specific samples.

This paper presents an algorithm developed to compute automatically local corrections. This algorithm has been successfully used in the LHC and in simulations of the HL-LHC to establish tolerances for the magnetic errors. The limitations of the current \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ measurement technique (K-modulation) are studied, together with alternative techniques for \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ control: computing the minimum β near the IP using the betatron phase measured with new instrumentation and locating the beam waist via luminosity scans. This push toward smaller beam sizes also requires large β-functions in the arcs that enhance local errors currently negligible. Experimental results of a way of correcting this new type of local errors using orbit bumps in sextupoles is also presented. These studies forecast a drastic change in the LHC commissioning strategy to be applied in the HL-LHC for needing luminosity measurements in intermediate stages.},

VDs are especially useful in systems where measuring the output is invasive, limited, costly or runs the risk of altering the output. Given a prediction, it is necessary to relay how reliable that prediction is, i.e. quantify the uncertainty of the prediction. In this paper, we use ensemble methods and quantile regression neural networks to explore different ways of creating and analyzing prediction's uncertainty on experimental data from the Linac Coherent Light Source at SLAC National Lab. We aim to accurately and confidently predict the current profile or longitudinal phase space images of the electron beam. The ability to make informed decisions under uncertainty is crucial for reliable deployment of deep learning tools on safety-critical systems as particle accelerators.},

	abstract = {The equations of motion of the particles in a synchrotron in which the field gradient index n=-(rB)\${\textbackslash}partial\$B\${\textbackslash}partial\$r varies along the equilibrium orbit are examined on the basis of the linear approximation. It is shown that if n alternates rapidly between large positive and large negative values, the stability of both radial and vertical oscillations can be greatly increased compared to conventional accelerators in which n is azimuthally constant and must lie between 0 and 1. Thus aperture requirements are reduced. For practical designs, the improvement is limited by the effects of constructional errors; these lead to resonance excitation of oscillations and consequent instability if 2νx or 2νz or νx + νz is integral, where νx and νz are the frequencies of horizontal and vertical betatron oscillations, measured in units of the frequency of revolution. The mechanism of phase stability is essentially the same as in a conventional synchrotron, but the radial amplitude of synchrotron oscillations is reduced substantially. Furthermore, at a “transition energy” E1 \${\textbackslash}approx\$ νxMc2 the stable and unstable equilibrium phases exchange roles, necessitating a jump in the phase of the radiofrequency accelerating voltage. Calculations indicate that the manner in which this jump is performed is not very critical.},

	abstract = {In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), particle physics events are created by colliding high energy proton beams at a number of interaction points around the ring. One of the main performance indicating parameters of the LHC is the luminosity. The luminosity is limited by, amongst other things, the strength of the beam-beam interaction. In this thesis, the effect of the beam-beam interaction on the luminosity performance of the LHC and the proposed High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) is investigated. Results from a number of dedicated, long-range beam-beam separation for two different \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ optics are identified. This separation defines the minimum operational crossing angle in the LHC. The data from these studies are then compared to simulation of the dynamic aperture and the results are discussed. In addition to studies of the LHC, an analytical approach is derived in order to describe the hourglass effect, which may become a contributing factor in limiting the luminosity performance of the HL-LHC.},

	abstract = {The large hadron electron collider (LHeC) is a proposed upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) within the high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) project, to provide electron-nucleon collisions and explore a new regime of energy and luminosity for deep inelastic scattering. The design of an interaction region for any collider is always a challenging task given that the beams are brought into crossing with the smallest beam sizes in a region where there are tight detector constraints. In this case integrating the LHeC into the existing HL-LHC lattice, to allow simultaneous proton-proton and electron-proton collisions, increases the difficulty of the task. A nominal design was presented in the the LHeC conceptual design report in 2012 featuring an optical configuration that focuses one of the proton beams of the LHC to \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$=10 cm in the LHeC interaction point to reach the desired luminosity of L=1033 cm-2 s-1. This value is achieved with the aid of a new inner triplet of quadrupoles at a distance L\$\_{\textbackslash}ast\$=10 m from the interaction point. However the chromatic beta beating was found intolerable regarding machine protection issues. An advanced chromatic correction scheme was required. This paper explores the feasibility of the extension of a novel optical technique called the achromatic telescopic squeezing scheme and the flexibility of the interaction region design, in order to find the optimal solution that would produce the highest luminosity while controlling the chromaticity, minimizing the synchrotron radiation power and maintaining the dynamic aperture required for stability.},

	abstract = {This thesis investigates with a structured and precise analysis the behaviour of programs execution during trace-based just-in-time (JIT) compilation. The work was carried out in the context of the tracing just-in-time compiler LuaJIT embedded in the Next Generation of the Methodical Accelerator Design software (MAD-NG). MAD software series provides a scripting language, which is a de facto standard to describe particle accelerators, simulate beam dynamics, and optimise beam optics at CERN. It has to process a massive quantity of data and operations with user-defined expressions during simulation, hence it needs to be very efficient. A technology that fulfils these demands is LuaJIT, a trace-based just-in-time compiler for the Lua programming language. Trace-based just in time compilation is a technique used for dynamic interpreted languages. It consists of recording a linear path of frequently executed operations, so-called trace, compiling it to native machine code and executing it. To accomplish this work we proposed some extensions for the existing analysis tools provided by LuaJIT and we realised some post-processing analysis to inspect the traces generated by the JIT during the execution of a program. It is necessary to understand all the mechanisms performed by a tracing JIT compiler under the hood in order to better profit from trace-based just-in-time compilation. The consciousness of the internal mechanisms behind a tracing JIT compiler leads to take high-level software decision in JIT-friendly style.},

	abstract = {We model the build-up of inter-channel nonlinear interference noise (NLIN) in wavelength division multiplexed systems by considering the pulse collision dynamics in the time domain. The fundamental interactions can be classified as two-pulse, three-pulse, or four-pulse collisions and they can be either complete, or incomplete. Each type of collision is shown to have its unique signature and the overall nature of NLIN is determined by the relative importance of the various classes of pulse collisions in a given WDM system. The pulse-collision picture provides qualitative and quantitative insight into the character of NLIN, offering a simple and intuitive explanation to all of the reported and previously unexplained phenomena. In particular, we show that the most important contributions to NLIN follow from two-pulse and four-pulse collisions. While the contribution of two-pulse collisions is in the form of phase-noise and polarization-state-rotation with strong dependence on modulation format, four-pulse collisions generate complex circular noise whose variance is independent of modulation format. In addition, two-pulse collisions are strongest when the collision is complete, whereas four-pulse collisions are strongest when the collision is incomplete. We show that two-pulse collisions dominate the formation of NLIN in short links with lumped amplification, or in links with distributed amplification extending over arbitrary length. In long links using lumped amplification the relative significance of four-pulse collisions increases, emphasizing the circularity of the NLIN while reducing its dependence on modulation format.},

	abstract = {The primordial matter of quarks and gluons, which filled our universe just after few micro-seconds of its creation through Big Bang, is expected to be created in the laboratory by colliding nuclei at relativistic energies. The ongoing nuclear collision programs at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are two experimental facilities, where matter in the state of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) can be created and characterized. Heavy quarks, mainly charm and bottom quarks, are considered as novel probes to characterize QGP, and hence the QCD matter. Heavy quark diffusion coefficients play a significant role to understand the properties of QCD matter. Experimental measurements of nuclear suppression factor and elliptic flow are able to constrain the heavy quark diffusion coefficients, which is a key ingredient for the phenomenological study and disentangle different energy loss models. We give a general perspective of heavy quark diffusion coefficient in QGP and discuss its potential as a probe to disentangle different hadronization mechanisms, as well as to probe the initial electromagnetic field produced in non-central collisions. Experimental perspective on future measurements are discussed with special emphasis on heavy-flavors as next generation probes.},

It has been already successfully used in 2005 and 2006 to operate the Low Energy Ion Ring accelerator (LEIR), SPS and LHC transfer lines, replacing the existing old software. This paper presents an overview of the architecture, the status of current development and future plans. The system is entirely written in Java and it is using the Spring framework, an open-source lightweight container for Java platform, taking advantage of dependency injection (DI), aspect oriented programming (AOP) and provided services like transactions or remote access. Additionally, all LSA applications can run in 2-tier mode as well as in 3-tier mode; thus the system joins benefits of 3-tier architecture with ease of development and testability of 2tier applications. Today, the architecture of the system is very stable. Nevertheless, there are still several areas where the current domain model needs to be extended in order to satisfy requirements of LHC operation.},

	abstract = {SixTrack is a single-particle tracking code for high-energy circular accelerators routinely used at CERN for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), its luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC), the Future Circular Collider (FCC) and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) simulations. The code is based on a 6D symplectic tracking engine, which is optimized for long-term tracking simulations and delivers fully reproducible results on several platforms. It also includes multiple scattering engines for beam– matter interaction studies, as well as facilities to run the integrated simulations with external particle matter interaction codes. These features differentiate SixTrack from general-purpose, optics-design software. The code recently underwent a major restructuring to merge the advanced features into a single branch, such as multiple ion species, interface with external codes and high-performance input/output. This restructuring also removed a large number of compilation flags, instead enabling/disabling the functionality with runtime options. In the process, the code was moved from Fortran 77 to Fortran 2018 standard, also allowing and achieving a better modularization. Physics models (beam– beam effects, Radio-Frequency (RF) multipoles, current carrying wires, solenoid and electron lenses) and methods (symplecticity check) have also been reviewed and refined to offer more accurate results. The SixDesk runtime environment allows the user to manage the large batches of simulations required for accurate predictions of the dynamic aperture. SixDesk supports several cluster environments available at CERN as well as submitting jobs to the LHC@Home volunteering computing project, which enables volunteers contributing with their hardware to CERN simulation. SixTrackLib is a new library aimed at providing a portable and flexible tracking engine for single- and multi-particle problems using the models and formalism of SixTrack. The library is able to run in CPUs as well as graphical processing units (GPUs). This contribution presents the status of the code, summarizes the main existing features and provides details about the main development lines SixTrack, SixDesk and SixTrackLib.},

The optics in the insertion regions in particular are very sensitive to errors in their elements, due to the extremely high beta-functions present. In this talk basic concepts of local and global corrections are presented and arguments made for the importance of extending these corrections to high-order magnetic field errors to improve beam stability and lifetime. These procedures are presented in the framework of my PhD-Thesis, in which I am concerned with the mitigation of these errors by utilizing resonance driving terms and investigating the effects from feed-down emerging from the non-zero closed orbit in the insertion regions. Results of my studies of the first half of my PhD are shown and discussed here together with an outlook on the upcoming second half.},

Based on previous studies, it was predicted that the current corrections would not be able to compensate this, thereby leading to a degradation of the dynamic aperture. On the other hand, the separation dipole D1 is expected to have a systematic \${\textbackslash}mathslb\$5 component of 6 units to 7 units and its contribution to the resonance driving terms will partly compensate the effect of D2, due to the opposite field strength of the main component. Simulations were performed to address these concerns and to verify the compensation assumption, yet confirmed that the errors could only be partly compensated. In addition, various normal decapole resonance driving terms were examined as correction targets and the dependence of feed-down to amplitude detuning on this choice was discovered.},

	abstract = {The optics in the insertion regions of the LHC and its upgrade project the High Luminosity LHC are very sensitive to local magnetic errors, due to the extremely high betafunctions. In collision optics, the non-zero closed orbit in the same region leads to a “feed-down” of high-order errors to lower orders, causing additional effects detrimental to beam lifetime. An extension to the well-established method for correcting these errors by locally suppressing resonance driving terms has been undertaken, not only taking this feeddown into account, but also adding the possibility of utilizing it such that the powering of higher-order correctors will compensate for lower order errors. Existing correction schemes have also operated on the assumption of (anti-)symmetric beta-functions of the optics in the two rings. This assumption can fail for a multitude of reasons, such as inherently asymmetric optics and unevenly distributed errors. In this respect, an extension of this correction scheme has been developed, removing the need for symmetry by operating on the two separate optics of the beams simultaneously. Unlike earlier implementations, the resonance driving terms to be corrected can also be changed flexibly. The mathematical background as well as some implementation details of this new enhancement are presented.},

	abstract = {It is well known from Maxwell theory that electromagnetic radiation is emitted whenever electric charges are accelerated in free space. This radiation assumes quite extraordinary properties whenever the charged particles move at ultrarelativistic speed: The radiation becomes very powerful and tightly collimated in space, and it may easily cover a rather wide spectrum ranging from the THz into the hard X-ray regime. When generation of such radiation is intended rather than being a side effect, the charged particles are normally electrons, thus kinetic energies are then typically in the multi-MeV range.},

This way the picket fence effect is reduced and a better approximation of DTFT local peaks is achieved for a finite number of measured points. In order to overcome the high computational demand problem of the zero padding method, an alternative one, is further presented in this paper. This method, making use of non-integer number of cycles in DFT kernel orthogonal signals, provide the same results in spectral analysis as zero padding method but with significant reduction of the computational effort. Moreover, the use of non-integer arguments for DFT evaluation open the possibility to develop DFT with variable bins resolution, narrow band DFT and bins interpolation algorithms.},

These operators can then be concatenated, following well-defined rules, to obtain a resultant operator that characterizes the entire system. New insight into the origin and possible correction of aberrations is provided. With some effort, it should be possible to produce, by manual calculations, explicit formulas for the third-, fourth-, and fifth-order aberrations of a general optical system including systems without axial symmetry. With the aid of symbolic manipulation computer programs, it should be possible to compute routinely explicit formulas for aberrations of seventh, eighth, and ninth order, and probably beyond.},

The basic mechanics of the scheme is shortly reminded, highlighting as well some of its by-products (Landau damping, long-range beam-beam mitigation with octupoles), and a recent improvement which made possible an early, but still partial, implementation of ATS optics in the LHC for the 2017 and 2018 LHC physics runs. The main focus of the paper will be on the experimental validation of the scheme, via the development of dedicated machine configurations and high-intensity beam tests which took place in Run 2. The paper will conclude on the configuration presently in mind to operate the LHC during its third exploitation period (Run 3), while trying to ensure a smooth enough transition toward the HL-LHC, in terms of optics, beam parameters, and dedicated beam manipulations (\${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$-leveling).},

	abstract = {The physics programme and the design are described of a new collider for particle and nuclear physics, the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC), in which a newly built electron beam of 60 GeV, to possibly 140 GeV, energy collides with the intense hadron beams of the LHC. Compared to the first ep collider, HERA, the kinematic range covered is extended by a factor of twenty in the negative four-momentum squared, Q2, and in the inverse Bjorken x, while with the design luminosity of 1033 cm-2 s-1 the LHeC is projected to exceed the integrated HERA luminosity by two orders of magnitude. The physics programme is devoted to an exploration of the energy frontier, complementing the LHC and its discovery potential for physics beyond the Standard Model with high precision deep inelastic scattering measurements. These are designed to investigate a variety of fundamental questions in strong and electroweak interactions. The LHeC thus continues the path of deep inelastic scattering (DIS) into unknown areas of physics and kinematics. The physics programme also includes electron-deuteron and electron-ion scattering in a (Q21/x) range extended by four orders of magnitude as compared to previous lepton-nucleus DIS experiments for novel investigations of neutron's and nuclear structure, the initial conditions of Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and further quantum chromodynamic phenomena. The LHeC may be realised either as a ring-ring or as a linac-ring collider. Optics and beam dynamics studies are presented for both versions, along with technical design considerations on the interaction region, magnets including new dipole prototypes, cryogenics, RF, and further components. A design study is also presented of a detector suitable to perform high precision DIS measurements in a wide range of acceptance using state-of-the art detector technology, which is modular and of limited size enabling its fast installation. The detector includes tagging devices for electron, photon, proton and neutron detection near to the beam pipe. Civil engineering and installation studies are presented for the accelerator and the detector. The LHeC can be built within a decade and thus be operated while the LHC runs in its high-luminosity phase. It so represents a major opportunity for progress in particle physics exploiting the investment made in the LHC.},

	abstract = {Optics measurements at the LHC are mainly based on turn-by-turn signal from hundreds of beam position monitors (BPMs). Faulty BPMs produce erroneous signal causing unreliable computation of optics functions. Therefore, detection of faulty BPMs prior to optics computation is crucial for adequate optics analysis. Most of the faults can be removed by applying traditional cleaning techniques. However, optics functions reconstructed from the cleaned turn-by-turn data systematically exhibit a few nonphysical values which indicate the presence of remaining faulty BPMs. A novel method based on the Isolation Forest algorithm has been developed and applied in LHC operation, allowing to significantly reduce the number of undetected faulty BPMs, thus improving the optics measurements. This report summarizes the operational results and discusses the evaluation of the developed method on simulations, including extensive studies and optimization of the preexisting cleaning technique and verification of a new method in terms of coupling measurement. The advantages of the chosen algorithm compared to some other unsupervised learning techniques are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The field of artificial intelligence is driven by the goal to provide machines with human-like intelligence. However modern science is currently facing problems with high complexity that cannot be solved by humans in the same timescale as by machines. Therefore there is a demand on automation of complex tasks. To identify the category of tasks which can be performed by machines in the domain of optics measurements and correction on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the central research subjects of this thesis. The application of machine learning methods and concepts of artificial intelligence can be found in various industry and scientific branches. In High Energy Physics these concepts are mostly used in offline analysis of experiments data and to perform regression tasks. In Accelerator Physics the machine learning approach has not found a wide application yet. Therefore potential tasks for machine learning solutions can be specified in this domain. The appropriate methods and their suitability for given requirements are to be investigated. The general question of this thesis is to identify the opportunities to apply machine learning methods to find and correct the errors in LHC optics and also to speed up beam measurements},

	title = {Introduction to the {Polymorphic} {Tracking} {Code}},
	url = {http://cds.cern.ch/record/573082},
	abstract = {This is a description of the basic ideas behind the “Polymorphic Tracking Code” or PTC. PTC is truly a “kick code” or symplectic integrator in the tradition of TRACYII, SixTrack, and TEAPOT. However it separates correctly the mathematical atlas of charts and the magnets at a structural level by implementing a “restricted fibre bundle.” The resulting structures allow backward propagation and recirculation, something not possible in standard tracking codes. Also PTC is polymorphic in handling real (single, double and even quadruple precision) and Taylor series. Therefore it has all the tools associated to the TPSA packages: Lie methods, Normal Forms, Cosy-Infinity capabilities, beam envelopesfor radiation, etc., as well as parameter dependence on-the-fly. However PTC is an integrator, and as such, one must, generally, adhere to the Talman “exactness” view of modelling. Incidentally, it supports exact sector and rectangular bends as well. Of course, one can certainly bypass its integrator and the user is free to violate Talman's principles on his own; PTC provides the tools to dig one's grave but not the encouragement. The reader will find in Appendix B a PowerPoint presentation of FPP. The presentation is a bit out of date but it gives a good idea of FPP which is essential to PTC. FPP is a stand-alone library and can be used by anyone with a FORTRAN90 compiler. This presentation is also, to be honest, a place where the authors intend to document very incompletely nearly two years of work: the development of FPP and subsequently that of PTC. Our ultimate intention is to morph PTC completely into MAD-X. The code MAD-X is an upgrade of MAD-8 and not of the C++ CLASSIC based code MAD-9. The present document does not address when and how this will be done. It is also our goal to link, if possible, PTC with CAD programs for the design of complex follow-the-terrain beam lines. So far FPP and PTC have been used in the design of beam separators (complex polymorphs) and recirculators. They have also been linked with the code BMAD from Cornell. There is still a lot of work to be done if these tools are to be generally usable by a wide range of people. In addition, more complex structures will be needed to handle effects beyond single particle dynamics in a way which respects the fundamental mathematical integrity of the structures of PTC.},

Their control are of great benefit to the dynamic aperture of an accelerator, whose enlargement leads in general to more efficient injection and longer lifetime. This article describes a procedure to evaluate and correct unwanted nonlinearities by using turn-by-turn beam position monitor data, which is an evolution of previous works on the resonance driving terms (RDTs). Effective sextupole magnetic errors and tilts at the ESRF electron storage ring are evaluated and corrected (when possible) by using this technique. For the first time, also octupolar RDTs could be measured and used to define an octupolar model for the main quadrupoles. Most of the deviations from the model observed in the sextupolar RDTs of the ESRF storage ring turned out to be generated by focusing errors rather than by sextupole errors. These results could be achieved thanks to new analytical formulas describing the harmonic content of the nonlinear betatron motion to the second order. For the first time, RDTs have been also used for beam-based calibration of individual sextupole magnets. They also proved to be a powerful tool in predicting faulty magnets and in validating magnetic models. This technique provides also a figure of merit for a self-assessment of the reliability of the data analysis.},

	url = {https://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/frontdoor/index/index/year/2006/docId/2270},
	abstract = {In this thesis a beam-based method has been developed to measure the strength and the polarity of corrector magnets (skew quadrupoles and sextupoles) in circular accelerators. The algorithm is based on the harmonic analysis (via FFT) of beam position monitor (BPM) data taken turn by turn from an accelerator in operation. It has been shown that, from the differences of the spectral line amplitudes between two consecutive BPMs, both the strength and the polarity of non-linear elements placed in between can be measured. The method has been successfully tested using existing BPM data from the SPS of CERN, since presently the SIS-18 is not equipped with the necessary hardware. The magnet strength of seven SPS extraction sextupoles was measured with a precision of about 10\%. The polarities have been unambiguously measured. This method can be used to detect polarity errors and wrong power supply connections during machine commissioning, as well as for a continuous monitoring of the "nonlinearity budget" in superconducting machines. A second beam-based method has been studied for a fast measurement and correction of betatron coupling driven by skew quadrupole field errors and tilted focusing quadrupoles. Traditional methods usually require a time-consuming scan of the corrector magnets in order to minimize the coupling stop band {\textbar}C{\textbar}. In this thesis it has been shown how the same correction can be performed in a single machine cycle from the harmonic analysis of multi-BPM data. The method has been successfully applied to RHIC. It has been shown that the stop band {\textbar}C{\textbar} (also known in the American literature as Delta-Qmin) measured in a single machine cycle with the new algorithm is compatible with the value obtained by traditional methods. The measurement of the resonance phase Theta defines automatically the best corrector setting, which was found in agreement with the one obtained with a traditional scan. A third theoretical achievement is a new description of the betatron motion close to the difference resonance in presence of linear coupling. Compared to the matrix formalism the motion is parametrized as a function of the resonance driving term f1001 only (which is proven to be an observable), whereas making use of the matrix approach four parameters need to be measured. Formulae describing the exchange of RMS emittances when approaching the resonances have been already derived in the 70s in the smooth approximation. New formulae have been derived here making use of Lie algebra providing a better description of the emittance behavior. The emittance exchange curves are predicted by new formulae with excellent agreement with multi-particle simulations and the counter-intuitive emittance variation along the ring of the emittance is proven to be related to the variation of f1001. A new way to decouple the equations of motion and explicit expressions for the individual single particle invariants have been found. For the first time emittance exchange studies have been carried out in the SIS-18 of GSI. Transverse RMS emittances have been measured during 2005 from rest gas monitor (RGM) data. Crossing the linear coupling resonance, the transverse emittances exchange completely. It has been observed that this effect is reversible. Applications of this manipulation are: emittance equilibration under consideration for future operations of the SIS-18 as booster for the SIS-100; emittance transfer during multi-turn injection to improve the eficiency and to protect the injection septum in high intensity operations, by shifting part of the horizontal emittance into the vertical plane. The emittance exchange curves obtained experimentally have been compared with analytic formulae providing a fast measurement (in few machine cycles only) of the linear coupling stop band {\textbar}C{\textbar}. Technical problems prevented the use of the eight skew quadrupoles installed in the SIS-18 to compensate the linear coupling resonance. It has been observed that the emittance exchange curve is highly sensitive to the beam intensity. Multi-particle simulations with 2D PIC space-charge solver have been run to infer heuristic scaling laws able to quantify the observable stop band, to be used for the resonance compensation. The analysis of BPM and RGM data has been performed making use of new software applications developed for this purpose. The bpm2rdt code for the harmonic analysis of BPM data has been written and tested with real data. The software reads the BPM turn-by-turn data and the Twiss parameters. Then it performs the FFT of these data, finds the peaks of the Fourier spectra and infers the RDT fjklm, the strengths ĥjklm and the local terms lambda-jklm. All these observables are printed out together with the corresponding values of the model, computed from the nominal values of strengths and the Twiss parameters. From the FFT of dual-plane BPM data the linear optics (beta functions and phase advances Delta phi) at the corresponding location is also inferred. From the measurement of f1000, the linear coupling coeffcient C (amplitude and phase) is also computed. The code has been tested by using existing SPS data and new RHIC data. For the on-line analysis of RGM data the rgm2emitt code has been written. The application reads in input the raw data files from the RGM and the beam loss monitor (BLM) respectively, the latter created by the RGM on-line software itself. From the RGM data the transverse beam sizes and emittances are inferred and used together with the BLM data to compute the tune shift during the machine cycle.},

This method consists in exciting large coherent oscillations of the beam without spoiling its emittance. A gentle control of the oscillation amplitude enables re-using the beams for several measurements.

	abstract = {The beam aperture of a particle accelerator defines the clearance available for the circulating beams and is a parameter of paramount importance for the accelerator performance. At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the knowledge and control of the available aperture is crucial because the nominal proton beams carry an energy of 362 MJ stored in a superconducting environment. Even a tiny fraction of beam losses could quench the superconducting magnets or cause severe material damage. Furthermore, in a circular collider, the performance in terms of peak luminosity depends to a large extent on the aperture of the inner triplet quadrupoles, which are used to focus the beams at the interaction points. In the LHC, this aperture represents the smallest aperture at top-energy with squeezed beams and determines the maximum potential reach of the peak luminosity. Beam-based aperture measurements in these conditions are difficult and challenging. In this paper, we present different methods that have been developed over the years for precise beam-based aperture measurements in the LHC, highlighting applications and results that contributed to boost the operational LHC performance in Run 1 (2010-2013) and Run 2 (2015-2018).},

	url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/2701414},
	abstract = {Accurate measurements of the focusing properties of an accelerator are essential for proper operation of a synchrotron, both for the machine protection and for the performance of the experiment. Measurement of linear optics functions based on turn-by-turn measurements has been developed continuously in pursuit of more accurate results. Optics functions that describe the focusing properties of the machine can be obtained from different observables: phase and amplitude of the transverse betatron oscillations and the change of the tune by modulating the current of quadrupoles (K-modulation) . Reconstruction of linear optics using the phase, in combination with K-modulation, have been the main approaches for obtaining the \${\textbackslash}textbackslash beta\$-function in accelerators all over the world. Measurements of optics functions based on the amplitude, denoted as from amplitude, have not been used as widely as the other methods since it requires accurate beam-position-monitor (BPM) calibration. BPMs are key elements in accelerator operation, providing essential information about different beam parameters that are directly related to the accelerator performance. BPMs are calibrated before its installation in the accelerator to obtain an accurate conversion from an induced voltage to the centre of charge position. This calibration procedure can only be performed when the accelerator is in a period of non-activity and does not completely reproduce the exact conditions that occur during the machine operation. The studies presented in this thesis have served as improvement of the from amplitude approach, \${\textbackslash}textbackslash beta{\textasciicircum}\{A\}\$, and they can be summarized in two groups: developing of the uncertainty associated to the \${\textbackslash}textbackslash beta{\textasciicircum}\{A\}\$-function and mitigation of the BPM calibration factors effects. First, a study of the error-bar associated with the measured A-function is introduced using an analytical formalism that has been contrasted with simulations and experimental results. Second, a study of the BPM calibration factors based on optics measurements has been developed as part of this research. Discrepancies observed during the optics measurements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) between different \${\textbackslash}textbackslash beta\$-reconstruction approaches, show that the impact of the BPM calibration factors on the optics functions was higher than expected from the design values and tolerances. Measurement of the optics functions allows obtaining extra information on BPM calibration together with its associated uncertainty and resolution. This thesis summarizes the development of two different techniques to compute the BPMs calibration factors based on optics measurements accurately. These approaches have been developed using as a test bench the LHC and the PSB, and it is foreseen to extrapolate them to future accelerators. In case of LHC, the optics developed for computing the calibration factors only allows to accurately calibrate a limited range of BPMs located in the vicinity of the experiments denoted as IRs. The implementation of this approach in LHC and PSB is introduced in this thesis. Together with a summary of the hardware and software upgrades needed for its implementation. In case of LHC, calibration factors have been implemented in different machine configurations, in which the -function can be measured accurately using the three different approaches previously introduced: \${\textbackslash}textbackslash beta\$, \${\textbackslash}textbackslash beta{\textasciicircum}\{A\}\$ and K-modulation. In LHC IRs BPMs a systematic deviation of the BPM calibration was observed when reconstructing the \${\textbackslash}textbackslash beta\$-function using the \${\textbackslash}textbackslash beta{\textasciicircum}\{A\}\$-method with respect to the results obtained using the approach. By compensating the effect of the calibration factors in the measured \${\textbackslash}textbackslash beta{\textasciicircum}\{A\}\$-function, the average accuracy of the \${\textbackslash}textbackslash beta\$-function has improved in a 6\% in Beam 1 and 4\% in Beam 2 with respect to the direct measured A-function. On the other hand, in case of PSB, the validation of the calibration optics has been performed using the nominal optics used during the routine operations. Calibrating the BPMs using an optics-based approach has allowed decreasing the -function error bar, previously computed using the approach, by a factor of three.},

	abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider is designed to collide proton beams with unprecedented energy in order to extend the frontiers of high-energy physics. Particles that have an energy different from the nominal one follow dispersive orbits and, if the energy offset is large enough, could be lost on the cold aperture and cause quenches of superconducting magnets. Therefore, particles with large energy offsets must be removed from the beam by the collimation system. Although the dynamics of such particles is well understood and the efficiency of the momentum cleaning is evaluated in measurements, in the past, there were not general simulations tools available for predicting the efficiency of the collimation system in scenarios where off-momentum particles are involved. In this paper we present a new set of tools to simulate off-momentum losses, the benchmarking of these tools with measurements and the evaluation of off-momentum losses in the future LHC upgrade, the HL-LHC. These new simulation tools are applied for simulating two of the main scenarios where off-momentum particles play an important role in the LHC: particles lost at the start of the energy ramp and simulations of the momentum cleaning at 6.5 TeV energy. In this study, the collimation process during dynamic changes in the machine is simulated, as opposed to previous studies in static conditions. This is the first time that this sort of comparison between different simulation methods and measurements is performed. The results are used to provide a better understanding the dynamics of such particles and, finally, these tools are used to estimate the influence of off-momentum losses in the future High-Luminosity LHC.},

	abstract = {Maximization of the dynamic aperture and Landau damping of the collective instabilities are partly con icting requirements. On the one hand, the non-linearities of the lattice must be minimized at large oscillation amplitude to guarantee the stability of the single particle motion. On the other hand, a spread of the betatron frequencies is needed for the stability of the collective motion of bunches of particles this requires non-linearities e ective at small amplitudes. We show in this note that the `natural' spread of betatron tunes due to the eld imperfections is inadequate for Landau damping. An octupole scheme is required to provide collective stability at high energy. At low energy it may be used to nd the optimum between the correction of the octupolar eld imperfections and Landau damping. The solution of the stability problem taking into account the two degrees of freedom of the transverse motion allows a signi cant saving in octupole strength even though a safety margin is included: 144 octupoles with a magnetic length of 32 cm are needed, leaving some reserve slots for other correctors. The present localization close to the lattice quadrupoles is well adapted for Landau damping, but unfavourable for the correction of the octupolar imperfection of the dipoles. Depending on the multipolar errors in the dipoles, octupolar and skew octupolar spool pieces may have to be envisaged.},

	abstract = {The fractional part of the betatron tune for a circular accelerator can be measured by observing beam oscillations on a position pick-up.

Classical tune measurement systems filter out just one of the betatron sidebands. As a consequence, most of the betatron energy is lost and only a very small fraction remains for further processing. This paper describes a new method, referred to as Direct Diode Detection (3D). It is based on the idea of time stretching beam pulses from the pick-up in order to increase the betatron frequency content in the baseband. The 3D method was recently tested in the CERN SPS and PS, BNL RHIC and FNAL Tevatron machines. Results from all these machines [1, 2, 3, 4] show that this method can increase the betatron signal level by orders of magnitude as compared to classical systems, making it possible to observe tunes with no explicit excitation.

	abstract = {The fractional part of the tune value of a circular accelerator can be measured by observing the betatron oscillations of the beam on a position sensitive pick-up. In the frequency domain the betatron signal is seen as sidebands on the revolution harmonics. The bunches in the beam often have a very short length with respect to the revolution period, resulting in a wideband pick-up signal spectrum, containing many betatron lines. Classical tune measurement systems filter out just one or a few of these betatron sidebands. As a consequence, most of the betatron energy is lost and only a very small fraction remains for further processing. This paper describes a new method, referred to as Direct Diode Detection (3D), which overcomes this and a few other problems. The basic idea is to time stretch the beam pulses from the pick up in order to increase the betatron frequency content in the baseband. This can be accomplished by a simple diode detector followed by an RC low pass filter, as used in the common envelope detection technique for demodulating AM signals. It will be shown that such a circuit can increase the betatron signal level by orders of magnitude compared to classical systems. The 3D method was recently tested in the CERN SPS and PS machines with prototype base band tune (BBQ) measurement systems. Results will be presented showing that the prototypes were sensitive enough to see betatron oscillations in both machines with no added external excitation. The SPS system is also shown to be capable of measuring tunes with a resolution of 10-5 with no explicit excitation. Copies of the BBQ prototype are currently being tested on BNL-RHIC and FNAL-Tevatron as part of the US LARP collaboration, with a view to installing a similar system for tune measurement at the LHC},

At CERN, Machine Learning techniques have been applied to beam dynamics studies related to the Large Hadron Collider and its luminosity upgrade, in domains including beam measurements and machine performance optimization. In this paper, the recent applications of Machine Learning to the analyses of numerical simulations of nonlinear beam dynamics are presented and discussed in detail.

From the time evolution of the beam losses recorded during a collimator scan, in which collimator jaws are moved in steps toward the beam core cutting beam tails, one can extract information on the halo diffusion and its population as a function of the transverse amplitude. In this paper, results of the first scans performed at different beam intensities for both planes and both beams using the primary collimators of the betatron-cleaning system are presented. The scans were performed with squeezed optics and colliding beams after a few hours of regular physics production, during so-called end-of-fill measurements. Beam losses are measured with ionization chambers close to the collimators, which enable 1 and 100 Hz acquisitions, as well as diamond beam loss monitors, which enable turn-by-turn and bunch-by-bunch acquisitions. Parametric fits of a diffusion model are applied to the time profile of losses, for both total and individual bunch intensity. The analysis of the measurements performed in various conditions was used to estimate the diffusion coefficient as a function of the transverse amplitude and the population of LHC beam tails.},

This precise technique can be applied to the nonlinear lattice correction as well. The betatron phase probed by an off-axis beam provides information on the sextupole strength. In comparison with the model the nominal strength can be restored. It was shown that the proposed scheme treated all the leading order resonance driving terms generated by sextupoles, as well as the detuning terms and the nonlinear chromaticity. At NSLS-II a half percent sextupole correction led to a 15\% increase of the dynamic aperture.},

	abstract = {Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed— either explicitly or implicitly— to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, robustness, and/or speed. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis. The specific benefits of randomized techniques depend on the computational environment. Consider the model problem of finding the k dominant components of the singular value decomposition of an \$m {\textbackslash}textbackslash times n\$ matrix. (i) For a dense input matrix, randomized algorithms require \${\textbackslash}textbackslash bigO(mn {\textbackslash}textbackslash log(k))\$ floating-point operations (flops) in contrast to \$ {\textbackslash}textbackslash bigO(mnk)\$ for classical algorithms. (ii) For a sparse input matrix, the flop count matches classical Krylov subspace methods, but the randomized approach is more robust and can easily be reorganized to exploit multiprocessor architectures. (iii) For a matrix that is too large to fit in fast memory, the randomized techniques require only a constant number of passes over the data, as opposed to \${\textbackslash}textbackslash bigO(k)\$ passes for classical algorithms. In fact, it is sometimes possible to perform matrix approximation with a single pass over the data.},

	abstract = {We present an extension to the model-free anomaly detection algorithm, Isolation Forest. This extension, named Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), improves the consistency and reliability of the anomaly score produced for a given data point. We show that the standard Isolation Forest produces inconsistent scores using score maps. The score maps suffer from an artifact generated as a result of how the criteria for branching operation of the binary tree is selected. We propose two different approaches for improving the situation. First we propose transforming the data randomly before creation of each tree, which results in averaging out the bias introduced in the algorithm. Second, which is the preferred way, is to allow the slicing of the data to use hyperplanes with random slopes. This approach results in improved score maps. We show that the consistency and reliability of the algorithm is much improved using this method by looking at the variance of scores of data points distributed along constant score lines. We find no appreciable difference in the rate of convergence nor in computation time between the standard Isolation Forest and EIF, which highlights its potential as anomaly detection algorithm.},

	abstract = {Abstract Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves 1 and in the first imaging of a black hole 2 . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {As part of the Future Circular Collider study, the High Energy LHC (HE-LHC) is a proposed hadron collider situated in the already existing LHC tunnel. It aims at achieving a center of mass energy of 27 TeV, almost doubling the design c.o.m. energy of the LHC. This increase in energy relies on the use of 16 T Nb3Sn dipoles to be developed for the FCC-hh. The field quality of these dipoles is expected to have a big impact on the Dynamic Aperture (DA) at injection energy and subsequently tracking studies are conducted to evaluate the impact of magnetic field errors on the beam dynamics. In the following the results of these studies for the different injection energies considered for the HE-LHC are presented and a possible strategy for increasing the DA is discussed.},

With most of the observables being a sum of different error sources, careful disentangling is necessary in order to establish an optimal correction and allow for smooth operation. In the LHC, linear coupling has been proven to have a major impact on the beam dynamics and is taken to be one of the main sources of uncertainty when establishing corrections. In this paper an approach to evaluate the change of the Hamiltonian terms with linear coupling is presented. The validity of derived equations is demonstrated on a number of observables and benchmarked against simulations.},

	abstract = {The hadron collider options currently investigated as part of the FCC study rely on the use of dipoles with a field strength of 16 T or above in order to achieve the targeted collision energy. From simulations of the current design of these dipoles, a systematic sextupole component of up to factor 10 larger than in the LHC dipoles could be present in these magnets. A similar systematic mispowering of the corrector circuits as is assumed in the LHC may thus have a significantly larger impact on the dynamic aperture and in turn potentially also on the operational performance. During this MD, the dynamic aperture in the presence of large sextupole fields in the LHC at injection energy was measured. By deliberately mispowering the sextupole spool pieces attached to each dipole, a large systematic b3 component is generated and the subsequent change in chromaticity is corrected by the chromaticity sextupoles. Using both the aperture kicker and the AC-dipole as exciters, free and forced dynamic aperture as well as amplitude detuning were measured. Additional linear optics measurements provide insight into the contributions to coupling from the sextupole spool pieces.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear integrable optics is a recently proposed accelerator lattice design approach which allows to generate an amplitude dependent tune shift which is needed in high brightness accelerators to mitigate fast coherent instabilities. Whereas usually octupoles are used to achieve this task, this concept allows doing so without exciting any resonances, in turn preventing any particle loss. The concept is based around a special magnet design, together with specific constraints on the optics of the accelerator. To study such a system, the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) was recently constructed and commissioned at Fermilab. For the assessment of the performance of this concept, good knowledge of the optics and the (non-)linear dynamics without the special magnet is of key importance. As such, measurements were conducted in the IOTA ring, using the captured turn-by-turn data by the beam position monitors after excitation to infer quantities such as amplitude detuning and resonance driving terms. In this note, first results of these measurements are presented},

	abstract = {Following the recommendation of the European Strategy Group for Particle Physics, the Future Circular Collider (FCC) study was launched by CERN to investigate circular collider designs for a post-LHC era. Among the studied collider designs is a hadron- collider option aiming to collide proton at a center of mass energy of 100 TeV. This hadron collider option (FCC-hh) follows a similar layout as the LHC with two high luminosity experimental insertions, meant to complement each other and two low lumi- nosity experiments. This thesis studies the option of combining these low luminosity experiments with the injection in the FCC-hh. Using a contrary design approach to the combined insertion in the LHC and taking into account the constraint from the injection a layout was developed. The goal when developing the beam optics for the insertion was to achieve the lowest possible beam size in the interaction point to guarantee a high event rate. Furthermore, the impact of magnetic field errors in the magnets of this insertion on the beam stability was studied and are discussed in this thesis. In addition, a possible strategy is then presented which would allow to further increase the event rate},

	abstract = {Brightness is an important parameter for any synchrotron radiation source. Correcting the emittance coupling is one of the ways to increase photon beam brightness in the operational storage ring. The main source of this effect is betatron coupling, resulting from the skew quadrupolar errors. Tune split and Linear Optics from Closed Orbit (LOCO) techniques are used to measure the betatron coupling. We discuss the measurement result of betatron coupling and its correction in the Indus-2 storage ring using available four power supplies, as the knobs, driving the skew quadrupole windings located on sextupoles. The measured coupling ratio of \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.8\% closely matches with the coupling ratio obtained from the LOCO fit model. Based on LOCO correction, the coupling ratio can be reduced to \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.4\%, which is limited by the degrees of freedom and not by the field strengths. To achieve a smaller and controlled value of coupling, simulation studies based on the LOCO fit model and using the multi-objective differential evolution algorithm with more skew quadrupole power supplies are performed in Indus-2. With sixteen independent power supplies, the emittance ratio can be reduced to \${\textless}\$0.04\% and the brightness enhances by an order of magnitude. Besides, the optimization method used provides quantitative trade-offs between coupling related parameters such as beam tilt angle, emittance ratio, vertical emittance, and vertical beam size, and desired values can be chosen from the Pareto optimal front.},

	abstract = {In order to obtain the necessary luminosity with a reasonable amount of beam power, the Compact LInear Collider (CLIC) design includes an unprecedented collision beam size of σy=1 nm vertically and σx=45 nm horizontally. With exceptionally small and flat beams, the luminosity can be significantly degraded due to the combination of the experimental solenoid field and a large crossing angle. The two main effects reducing the luminosity are y-x\$'\$-coupling and an increase of vertical dispersion. Additionally, incoherent synchrotron radiation (ISR) from the orbit deflection created by the solenoid field increases the beam emittance and results in unrecoverable luminosity degradation. A novel approach to evaluate the ISR effect from a realistic solenoid field without knowledge of the full compensation of the geometric aberrations is presented. This approach is confirmed by a detailed study of the correction techniques to compensate the beam optics distortions. The unrecoverable luminosity loss due to ISR for CLIC at 3 TeV has been evaluated, and found to be around 4\% to 5\% for the solenoid design under study.},

Following the tendency to reduce dependence on the configuration of the preceding proton run, a completely new optics cycle with the strongest ever focussing at the ALICE and LHCb experiments was designed and rapidly implemented, demonstrating the maturity of the collider's operating modes. Beam-loss monitor thresholds were carefully adjusted to provide optimal protection from the multiple loss mechanisms in heavy-ion operation. A switch from a basic bunch-spacing of 100 ns to 75 ns was made as the beam became available from the injector chain. A new record luminosity, 6 times the original design and close to the operating value proposed for HL-LHC, provided validation of the strategy for mitigating quenches due to bound-free pair production (BFPP) at the interaction points of the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Most of the beam parameters of the HL-LHC Pb-Pb upgrade were attained during this run and the integrated luminosity goals for the first 10 years of LHC operation were substantially exceeded.},

Higher beam energies can be realized by pushing the installed main dipoles to their limits or by replacing different fractions of installed magnets. Moreover, a revised lattice design for a full energy upgrade, also known as the high-energy LHC (HE-LHC), is presented. The studies reported focus on the linear optics design and on the lattice layout. In particular, an optics with 60° transverse phase advance in the regular arc cells, meant to alleviate the strength requirements for the main quadrupoles, has been designed in view of possible beam tests during the next LHC run 3. The methods developed in this article, for matching the ring geometry to a reference tunnel, for improving the beam aperture, and for minimizing the required field strengths for new high-energy LHC-like machines, will also be applicable to other future circular collider projects.},

	abstract = {Several transverse noise sources, such as power supply ripples, can potentially act as an important limiting mechanism for the luminosity production of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its future High-Luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). In the presence of non-linearities, depending on the spectral components of the power supply noise and the nature of the source, such a mechanism can increase the diffusion of the particles in the distribution through the excitation of sideband resonances in the vicinity of the ones driven by the lattice non-linearities. For the HL-LHC, due to the reduction of the beam size in the Interaction Points (IP) of the high luminosity experiments (IP1 and 5), increased sensitivity to noise effects is anticipated for the quadrupoles of the inner triplets. The modulation that may arise from the power supply ripples will be combined with the tune modulation that intrinsically emerges from the coupling of the transverse and longitudinal plane for off-momentum particles through chromaticity. To this end, the aim of this paper is to study the impact of tune modulation effects on the transverse beam motion resulting from the interplay between quadrupolar power supply ripples and synchro-betatron coupling. A power supply noise threshold for acceptable performance is estimated with single-particle tracking simulations by investigating the impact of different modulation frequencies and amplitudes on the Dynamic Aperture. The excitation of sideband resonances due to the modulation is demonstrated with frequency maps and the higher sensitivity to specific modulation frequencies is explained. Finally, a power supply noise spectrum consisting of several tones is considered in the simulations to determine whether the presence of power supply ripples in the quadrupoles of the inner triplet will limit the luminosity production in the HL-LHC era.},

The collider experiment provides optimum conditions for efficient energy scan measurements. Attainment of the required average luminosity of the order of 1027 cm-2\${\textbackslash}cdot\$s-1 for such physics experiment faces several accelerator physics and technology challenges. Contrary to high energy colliders, the luminosity of NICA case will be mostly limited by the Laslett tune shift, while the beam-beam tune shift parameter will be negligibly small. Flexible operational procedures for the beam storage and short bunch formation have been developed to provide maximum peak luminosity over wide energy range. Beam cooling is critical to counteract luminosity decay due to intra-beam scattering. NICA collider design addresses these issues and satisfies all the requirements for the colliding beams experiments.},

	abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is currently the world's largest particle accelerator with the highest center of mass energy in particle collision experiments. The control of the particle beam focusing is essential for the performance reach of such an accelerator. For the characterization of the focusing properties at the LHC, turn-by-turn beam position data is simultaneously recorded at numerous measurement devices (BPMs) along the accelerator, while an oscillation is excited on the beam. A novel analysis method for these measurements (\$N\$-BPM method) is developed here, which is based on a detailed analysis of systematic and statistical error sources and their correlations. It has been applied during the commissioning of the LHC for operation at an unprecedented energy of 6.5 TeV. In this process a stronger focusing than its design specifications has been achieved. This results in smaller transverse beam sizes at the collision points and allows for a higher rate of particle collisions. For the derivation of the focusing parameters at many synchrotron light sources, the change of the beam orbit is observed, which is induced by deliberate changes of magnetic fields (orbit response matrix). In contrast, the analysis of turn-by-turn beam position measurements is for many of these machines less precise due to the distance between two BPMs. The \$N\$-BPM method overcomes this limitation by allowing to include the measurement data from more BPMs in the analysis. It has been applied at the ALBA synchrotron light source and compared to the orbit response method. The significantly faster measurement with the \$N\$-BPM method is a considerable advantage in this case. Finally, an outlook is given to the challenges which lie ahead for the control of the beam focusing at the HL-LHC, which is a future major upgrade of the LHC.},

	abstract = {The beam interruptions (interlocks) of particle accelerators, despite being necessary safety measures, lead to abrupt operational changes and a substantial loss of beam time. A novel time series classification approach is applied to decrease beam time loss in the High Intensity Proton Accelerator complex by forecasting interlock events. The forecasting is performed through binary classification of windows of multivariate time series. The time series are transformed into Recurrence Plots which are then classified by a Convolutional Neural Network, which not only captures the inner structure of the time series but also utilizes the advances of image classification techniques. Our best performing interlock-to-stable classifier reaches an Area under the ROC Curve value of \$0.71 {\textbackslash}textbackslash pm 0.01\$ compared to \$0.65 {\textbackslash}textbackslash pm 0.01\$ of a Random Forest model, and it can potentially reduce the beam time loss by \$0.5 {\textbackslash}textbackslash pm 0.2\$ seconds per interlock.},

This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},

This was prompted by a need to extend the scope of beam-based commissioning at high-energy, beyond the exclusively linear realm considered previously, and into the nonlinear regime. It also stemmed from a recognition that, due to operation with crossing angles in the experimental insertions, the linear and nonlinear optics quality were intrinsically linked through potentially significant feed-down at these locations. Following the usual linear optics commissioning therefore, corrections for (normal and skew) sextupole and (normal and skew) octupole errors in the high-luminosity insertions were implemented. For the first time, the LHC now operates at top-energy with beam-based corrections for nonlinear dynamics, and for the effect of the crossing-scheme on beta-beating and dispersion. The new commissioning procedure has improved the control of various linear and nonlinear characteristics of the LHC, yielding clear operational benefits.

	abstract = {Nonlinear magnetic errors in low-β insertions can contribute significantly to detuning with amplitude, linear and nonlinear chromaticity, and lead to degradation of dynamic aperture and beam lifetime. As such, the correction of nonlinear errors in the experimental insertions of colliders can be of critical significance for successful operation. This is expected to be of particular relevance to the LHC's second run and its high luminosity upgrade, as well as to future colliders such as the Future Circular Collider. Current correction strategies envisioned for these colliders assume it will be possible to calculate optimized local corrections through the insertions, using a magnetic model of the errors. This paper shows however, that reliance purely upon magnetic measurements of the nonlinear errors of insertion elements is insufficient to guarantee a good correction quality in the relevant low-β* regime. It is possible to perform beam-based examination of nonlinear magnetic errors via the feed-down to readily observed beam properties upon application of closed orbit bumps, and methods based upon feed-down to tune have been utilized at RHIC, SIS18, and SPS. This paper demonstrates the extension of such methodology to include direct observation of feed-down to linear coupling in the LHC. It is further shown that such beam-based studies can be used to complement magnetic measurements performed during LHC construction, in order to validate and refine the magnetic model of the collider. Results from first attempts of the measurement and correction of nonlinear errors in the LHC experimental insertions are presented. Several discrepancies of beam-based studies with respect to the LHC magnetic model are reported.},

Hence, several results were available to aid comprehension of the behavior of charged particle beams under the influence of nonlinear forces. Here, we discuss how concepts derived from the theory of dynamical systems, linked with the fundamental Kolmogorov– Arnold– Moser theory and Nekhoroshev theorem, can be successfully applied to the analysis of nonlinear motion of charged particles in a circular accelerator. Based on these ideas, an innovative method to measure the extent of the phase-space region within which bounded motion occurs is presented, which has been successfully tested for the first time at the CERN LHC.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear errors in experimental insertions can pose a significant challenge to the operability of low-\${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ colliders. When crossing schemes are applied high-order errors, such as decapole and dodecapole multipole components in triplets and separation dipoles, can feed-down to give a normal octupole perturbation. Such fields may contribute to distortion of the assumed tune footprint, influencing lifetime and the Landau damping of instabilities. Conversely, comparison of amplitude detuning coefficients with and without crossing schemes applied should allow for the beam-based study of such high-order errors. In this note first measurements of amplitude detuning with crossing bumps in the experimental insertions are reported},

As the LHC progresses to more challenging regimes of operation it is to be expected that the nonlinear single particle dynamics in the transverse planes will play an increasing role in limiting the reach of the accelerator. As such it is vital that the nonlinear sources are well understood. The nonlinear fields of a circular accelerator may be probed through measurement of the amplitude detuning: the variation of tune with single particle emittance. This quantity may be assessed experimentally by exciting the beam to large amplitudes with kicks, and obtaining the tunes and actions from turn-by-turn data at Beam Position Monitors. The large amplitude excitations inherent to such a measurement also facilitate measurement of the dynamic aperture from an analysis of beam losses following the kicks. In 2012 these measurements were performed on the LHC Beam 2 at injection energy (450 GeV) with the nominal magnetic configuration. Nonlinear coupling was also observed. A second set of measurements were performed following the application of corrections for b4 and b5 errors. Analysis of the experimental results, and a comparison to simulation are presented herein.},

	abstract = {So far, the LHC has operated without any dedicated commissioning of the nonlinear optics at top energy. As \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ is reduced however, the impact of nonlinear errors in experimental insertions may become sizable. Below \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ = 0.8 m, and in particular with possible LHC configurations approaching 0.3 m, an operational impact from uncompensated nonlinear errors in the IRs is to be expected. Notably the contribution of normal octupole errors in IR1 and IR5 to the tune footprint becomes comparable to that created by the Landau octupoles, with implications for the performance of instrumentation and Landau damping of instabilities. In the HL-LHC compensation of IR-nonlinear sources may become a critical issue, with feed-down from IR-sextupole errors having the potential to generate substantial linear optics perturbations. This effect will require an evolution of the linear optics commissioning strategy in the LHC and HL-LHC. Current understanding of the impact of these errors and our ability to correct them will be reported. Nonlinear optics commissioning activities undertaken elsewhere in the machine cycle will also be introduced.},

	abstract = {Abstract Nonlinear magnetic errors in low- \$\${\textbackslash}textbackslash beta\$\$ β insertions can have a significant impact on the beam-dynamics of a collider, such as the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). Indeed, correction of sextupole and octupole magnetic errors in LHC experimental insertions has yielded clear operational benefits in recent years. Numerous studies predict, however, that even correction of nonlinearitites up to dodecapole order will be required to ensure successful exploitation of the HL-LHC. It was envisaged during HL-LHC design that compensation of high-order errors would be based upon correction of specific resonances, as determined from magnetic measurements during construction. Experience at the LHC demonstrated that beam-based measurement and correction of the sextupole and octupole errors was an essential complement to this strategy. As such, significant interest also exists regarding the practicality of beam-based observables of multipoles up to dodecapole order. Based on experience during the LHC's second operational run, the viability of beam-based observables relevant to dodecapole order errors in the experimental insertions of the HL-LHC are assessed and discussed in detail in this paper.},

	url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/1697983},
	abstract = {Physicists use self-written software as a tool to fulfill their tasks and often the developed software is used for several years or even decades. If a software product lives for a long time, it has to be changed and adapted to external influences. This implies that the source code has to be read, understood and modified. The same applies to the software of the Optics Measurements and Corrections (OMC) team at CERN. Their task is to track, analyze and correct the beams in the LHC and other accelerators. To solve this task, they revert to a self-written software base with more than 150,000 physical lines of code. The base is subject to continuous changes as well. Their software does its job and is effective, but runs regrettably not efficient because some parts of the source code are in a bad shape and has a low quality. The implementation could be faster and more memory efficient. In addition it is difficult to read and understand the code. Source code files and functions are too big and identifiers do not reveal the intention of the coder and are meaningless or even misleading. Thus it isn't easy to modify and extend the code. However, this is also a common problem in software engineering. The improving of productivity and quality in software development is still a field of research. This thesis is about the improvement of the software quality in the OMC team by adopting several techniques from professional software development. A more professional development environment was created and the quality of the existing software base was improved. Further, the members of the OMC team were sensitized to write directly clean code, to practice pair programming and to review each others source code. To measure software quality, a tailored quality model was defined. Code modifications trigger automatically an analysis tool to create metrics, based on the quality model, and present them in a dashboard. A trend anaylysis of this data will show if future developments will increase the software quality. In case that it becomes worse, appropriate steps can be initiated to refactor the corresponding source code parts. In addition a best practices guide was developed in the course of this thesis, which can be used to improve the software quality in any other team.},

	abstract = {Precise control of beam optics and beam stability is of critical importance for machine protection and performance of today's high-energy particle accelerators. For the next generation of accelerators, the tolerances are even tighter. This thesis presents new methods and improved techniques to efficiently identify, measure and correct a range of errors in particle accelerators. Circular and linear accelerators have been studied in parallel. The Circular Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collides mostly protons at energies of 6.5 TeV and European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) storage ring accelerates electrons to produce synchrotron light. The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) will provide electron-positron collisions at centre of mass energies up to 3 TeV. In CLIC, a non-colliding beam, referred to as drive beam, generates RF power to accelerate the main beam. LHC's optics measurement scheme was improved, also by studying ESRF. This resulted in significantly improved \${\textbackslash}textbackslash beta\$-function measurement, achieving twice the best-documented precision so far. The optics correction algorithm was improved allowing \${\textbackslash}textbackslash beta\$-beating in the LHC to systematically reach a level below 1.8\% rms. An adiabatic simultaneous 3-dimensional beam excitation, which combines AC-dipoles with RF-frequency modulation, significantly sped up beam optics measurements. The analysis of beam frequency spectra from turn-by-turn data was also made significantly faster, in the LHC by a factor \${\textbackslash}textbackslash sim 300\$. These results contributed to LHC's excellent performance beyond its designed targets. They also contributed towards its upgrade the High Luminosity LHC. CLIC has stringent requirements on drive beam stability in terms of beam current, energy and phase. In the CLIC Test Facility 3 (CTF3), a novel algorithm to identify drifts and correlations was developed and applied in a study of drive beam stabilisation. The underlying causes of drifts were found and multiple beam-based feedbacks were developed and commissioned in CTF3, in this way achieving the stability goals. These improvements therefore played a key role in demonstrating the viability of CLIC in terms of drive beam stability.},

Chromatic parameters need measurements to be repeated at different beam energies, which is time-consuming. We present an optics measurement method based on adiabatic simultaneous 3-dimensional beam excitation, where no repetition at different energies is needed. In the LHC, the method has been successfully demonstrated utilising AC-dipoles combined with RF frequency modulation. It allows measuring the linear optics parameters and chromatic properties at the same time without resolution deterioration. We also present a new accurate harmonic analysis algorithm that exploits the noise cleaning based on singular value decomposition to compress the input data.

The vertical chromaticities of the nominal and ultralow \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ lattices are comparable to those of ILC and CLIC, respectively. When the measured multipole components of the ATF2 magnets are considered in the simulations, the evaluated spot sizes at the IP are well above the design values. In this paper we describe the analysis of the high order aberrations that allows identifying the sources of the observed beam size growth. In order to recover the design spot sizes three solutions are considered, namely final doublet replacement, octupole insertion, and optics modification. Concerning the future linear collider projects, the consequences of magnetic field errors of the focusing quadrupole magnet of the final doublet are also addressed.},

In previous studies, 90\% of the machines reached 90\% of the nominal luminosity at the expense of 18 000 luminosity measurements, when considering beam position monitor errors and transverse misalignments of magnets for a single beam case. In the present study, additional static imperfections such as roll misalignments and strength errors are included. Moreover both e- and e+ beamlines are properly simulated.

Inevitable errors like imperfection of magnetic field and misalignment of magnets will introduce various destructive effects on the performance of the machine.

The hierarchy breakage seen in a similar activity in 2015 when deploying 1 σ-retractions between TCSG and TCP collimators was confirmed, and a viable solution demonstrated with beam. In addition, measurements of tune shifts induced by changes in collimator gaps were performed when moving the IR7 TCSG collimators all together, or when moving only those with the largest contribution to impedance. The MD activity included a re-alignment of all the IR7 collimators to the beam, prior to the investigations on the hierarchy breakage, and an instability threshold measurement, at the end. The MD activity is important for understanding the limitations from impedance; these limitations have direct impact on the choice of the machine configuration kept during operation (e.g. for deploying TCP-TCSG retractions in IR7 smaller than the present ones), or for optimising the design of future devices (e.g. as presently foreseen by the HL-LHC project, since outcomes are important ingredients for finalizing the baseline configuration of the upgraded collimation system).},

	abstract = {As the beam intensity increases, the beam can no longer be considered as a collection of non-interacting single particles: in addition to the “single-particle phenomena”, “collective effects” become significant. At low intensity a beam of charged particles moves around an accelerator under the Lorentz force produced by the “external” electromagnetic fields (from the guiding and focusing magnets, RF cavities, etc.). However, the charged particles also interact with themselves (leading to space charge effects) and with their environment, inducing charges and currents in the surrounding structures, which create electromagnetic fields called wake fields. In the ultra-relativistic limit, causality dictates that there can be no electromagnetic field in front of the beam, which explains the term “wake”. It is often useful to examine the frequency content of the wake field (a time domain quantity) by performing a Fourier transformation on it. This leads to the concept of impedance (a frequency domain quantity), which is a complex function of frequency. The charged particles can also interact with other charged particles present in the accelerator (leading to two-stream effects, and in particular to electron cloud effects in positron/hadron machines) and with the counter-rotating beam in a collider (leading to beam– beam effects). As the beam intensity increases, all these “perturbations” should be properly quantified and the motion of the charged particles will eventually still be governed by the Lorentz force but using the total electromagnetic fields, which are the sum of the external and perturbation fields. Note that in some cases a perturbative treatment is not sufficient and the problem has to be solved self consistently. These perturbations can lead to both incoherent (i.e. of a single particle) and coherent (i.e. of the centre of mass) effects, in the longitudinal and in one or both transverse directions, leading to beam quality degradation or even partial or total beam losses. Fortunately, stabilising mechanisms exist, such as Landau damping, electronic feedback systems and linear coupling between the transverse planes (as in the case of a transverse coherent instability, one plane is usually more critical than the other).},

Furthermore, simulations can be used as a tool for the analysis of new concepts. In the context of my summer student project, I did simulations of some non-linear effects in the LHC for comparison with recent measurements at maximal beam energy. I used the LHC model to analyse the dynamic aperture of the LHC with AC dipole, meaning with forced beam oscillations. This gives a deeper understanding of the beam dynamics with AC dipole. As result of these studies, the operation of the AC dipole can be improved. Moreover, I had the opportunity to participate in measurements on the LHC during MD.},

Nevertheless, the sensitivity of the system to errors and its mitigation was missing in the comparison. In this paper, an extended comparison of the Compact Linear Collider local FFS and an improved nonlocal FFS is presented at 3 TeV and 500 GeV. We demonstrate that, at high energies, luminosity delivered by the ideal machine is no longer the most important figure of merit but the recovered luminosity after tuning with imperfections, where the improved traditional scheme shows a better performance. This result might have an important relevance also for ILC at 1 TeV.},

The beam screen is a complex assembly that guarantees the vacuum requirements while shielding the magnet cold mass from the induced heat loads. Such an assembly has to withstand high intensity electromagnetic forces induced during magnet quenches. The mechanical stability was verified in a dedicated quench test campaign performed at the magnet test station of CERN. Strain gauges, custom-made probes, and optical fibers were installed in the beam screen to measure deformations during a quench. Magnetic field measurements were also carried out by means of pick-up coils mounted within the assembly. The main outcomes of this work are the elastic behaviour of the beam screen after 52 quenches and a satisfactory agreement between measurements and simulations.},

	url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/1451296},
	abstract = {In this thesis, the problem of the transverse coupled-bunch instabilities created by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) beam-coupling impedance, that can possibly limit the machine operation, is addressed thanks to several new theories and tools. A rather complete vision of the problem is proposed here, going from the calculation of the impedances and wake functions of individual machine elements, to the beam dynamics study. Firstly, new results are obtained in the theory of the beam-coupling impedance for an axisymmetric two-dimensional structure, generalizing Zotter's theories, and a new general theory is derived for the impedance of an infinite flat two-dimensional structure. Then, a new approach has been found to compute the wake functions from such analytically obtained beam-coupling impedances, over-coming limitations that could be met with standard discrete Fourier transform procedures. Those results are then used to obtain an impedance and wake function model of the LHC, based on the (resistive-) wall impedances of various contributors (collimators, beam screens and vacuum pipe) and additional estimations of the geometrical impedance contributions. Finally, the existing code HEADTAIL, which is a macroparticle simulation code for beam dynamics studies with wake fields, is improved to make possible the simulation of multibunch trains, and a spectral analysis technique is found to facilitate the analysis of the output given by this code, giving the complex tune shifts of the unstable modes present in a simulation. All those theories and tools are used to obtain new results concerning the LHC transverse coupled-bunch instabilities, demonstrating the rather small impact on coupled-bunch instabilities of the number of bunches in a train when the bunch spacing is fixed, and the existence of coupled-bunch modes with intrabunch motion which are more critical than their single-bunch counterparts. A full verification of the complete procedure (impedance theories, impedance model and simulation code) is also performed by comparing the simulation results with actual measurements in the LHC, giving a very good agreement at injection energy and a correct order of magnitude at 3.5 TeV/c. In the end, several predictions concerning the beam stability at the future 7 TeV/c operation of the machine are performed in the case of 50 ns spacing (1404 bunches), revealing that the coupled-bunch transverse mode coupling instability threshold is far above the ultimate bunch intensity but about 20\% smaller than its single-bunch counterpart. Stability studies with Landau octupoles at their maximum currents reveal that the beam remains stable at nominal intensity with Q' = 2 in both planes, provided the particle transverse distributions are Gaussian. At ultimate intensity with either Q' = 0 or Q' = 2, or at nominal intensity when the chromaticity is zero, the beam happens to be unstable, even with the octupoles at their maximum currents.},

	abstract = {The quality of optical signals is a very important parameter in optical communications. Several metrics are in common use, like optical signal-to-noise power ratio (OSNR), Q-factor, error vector magnitude (EVM) and bit error ratio (BER). A measured raw BER is not necessarily useful to predict the final BER after soft-decision forward error correction (FEC), if the statistics of the noise leading to errors is unknown. In this respect the EVM is superior, as it allows an estimation of the error statistics. We compare various metrics analytically, by simulation, and through experiments. We employ six quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) formats at symbol rates of 20 GBd and 25 GBd. The signals were generated by a software-defined transmitter. We conclude that for optical channels with additive Gaussian noise the EVM metric is a reliable quality measure. For nondata-aided QAM reception, BER in the range 10-6...10-2 can be reliably estimated from measured EVM.},

To have reliable performance of a collider, nominal luminosity must be reached quickly under a set of various imperfections. Measuring luminosity at high energies is a nontrivial task, and, to get a precise measurement, many collisions must be sampled. Therefore, it is desirable to use other beam-beam signals for faster tuning. This paper studies the use of beamstrahlung and incoherent pairs in an extensive simulation study including static imperfections. Tuning results of the nominal lattice are compared to an updated lattice with a smaller vertical beam size at the interaction point. Finally, recovery time after machine downtime and misalignment of components due to ground motion is also studied.},

The beam optics of the ATF2 beam line is designed based on a local chromaticity correction scheme similar to the ILC final focus system. Beam measurements in 2012 revealed skew sextupole field errors that were much larger than expected from magnetic field measurements. The skew sextupole field error was a critical limitation of the beam size at the ATF2 virtual interaction point (IP). Therefore, four skew sextupole magnets were installed to correct the field error in August 2012. By using the four skew sextupole magnets, the predicted tolerances of the skew sextupole field errors of the ATF2 magnets were increased. Furthermore, analyzing field maps of the sextupole magnets identified the source of the skew sextupole field error. After the field error source was removed, the IP vertical beam size could more easily be focused to less than 65 nm.},

After incorporation of the tethered dNTP, the 3\$'\$ end of the primer remains covalently bound to TdT and is inaccessible to other TdT– dNTP molecules. Cleaving the linkage between TdT and the incorporated nucleotide releases the primer and allows subsequent extension. We demonstrate that TdT– dNTP conjugates can quantitatively extend a primer by a single nucleotide in 10– 20 s, and that the scheme can be iterated to write a defined sequence. This approach may form the basis of an enzymatic oligonucleotide synthesizer.},

This paper investigates the fringe field impact on the transverse beam size in the ATF2, ILC, and CLIC lattices in the linear and non-linear regimes. The linear effects are studied by replacing the hard-edge quadrupolar field by the more realistic gradient fall-off. To address the nonlinear effects, the fringe fields are represented as high order kicks added to both sides of the hard-edge magnets. It will be shown that the linear fringe fields effects can be easily cured by tuning the quadrupole strengths. On the other hand, mitigation of the nonlinear fringe fields effects is more difficult and requires use of octupole magnets or, alternatively, increasing the value of interaction point horizontal beta function \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$x.},

	abstract = {A nanometer beam size at the interaction point (IP) is required for future linear colliders to achieve the desired rate of particle collisions. KEK Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2), a scaled down implementation of the linear collider beam delivery system, serves for demonstrating the feasibility of the final focus system (FFS). An unprecedented low vertical beam size at the IP of about 40 nm has been already measured in ATF2 using the optics with a nominal \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$y. In our study we decrease the \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$y value in order to investigate the performance of more chromatic optics and to study the limits of beam focusing at the IP. Stronger beam focusing amplifies the aberrations from the final focus imperfections which cause an increase of the beam size at the IP. Simulations show that the multipolar errors and final doublet fringe fields spoil the IP beam sizes for ultralow \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$y optics but can be mitigated either by increasing the value of the horizontal \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ or installing a pair of octupole magnets. We report on our first experimental steps towards the ultralow \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$y in ATF2. New methods for the beam diagnostics at the IP were developed in order to precisely set the desired optics. \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$y value was half the nominal value. The beam tuning was performed and the measured beam size is compared with the simulation results.},

The quality of the coupling measurements is increased, with about a factor 3, by selecting beam position monitor (BPM) pairs with phase advances close to π2 and through data cleaning using singular value decomposition with an optimal number of singular values. These improvements are beneficial for the implemented automatic coupling correction, which is based on injection oscillations, presented in the article. Furthermore, a proposed coupling feedback for the LHC is presented. The system will rely on the measurements from BPMs equipped with a new type of high resolution electronics, diode orbit and oscillation, which will be operational when the LHC restarts in 2015.

	abstract = {An amplitude dependent closest tune approach (ADeCTA) was first observed in the LHC in 2012. This potentially harmful effect can be generated by linear coupling in conjunction with octupoles. In this article we demonstrate experimentally and in simulations a configuration of the octupoles to suppress this recently observed effect. Furthermore, ADeCTA is investigated for the first time with driven oscillations. We show analytically that skew quadrupoles and normal octupoles do not generate ADeCTA for forced oscillations in the same way as for free oscillations. This adds an additional constraint to measure it since the forced oscillations, generated by an ac dipole, are the preferred option for optics measurements in the LHC. The analytical result is confirmed by both measurements and simulations.},

	abstract = {Ground motion is a severe problem for many particle accelerators, since it excites beam oscillations, which decrease the beam quality and create beam-beam offset (at colliders). Orbit feedback systems can only compensate ground motion effects at frequencies significantly smaller than the beam repetition rate. In linear colliders, where the repetition rate is low, additional counter measures have to be put in place. For this reason, a ground motion mitigation method based on feed-forward control is presented in this paper. It has several advantages compared to other techniques (stabilization systems and intratrain feedback systems) such as cost reduction and potential performance improvement. An analytical model is presented that allows the derivation of hardware specification and performance estimates for a specific accelerator and ground motion model. At the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF2), ground motion sensors have been installed to verify the feasibility of important parts of the mitigation strategy. In experimental studies, it has been shown that beam excitations due to ground motion can be predicted from ground motion measurements on a pulse-to-pulse basis. Correlations of up to 80\% between the estimated and measured orbit jitter have been observed. Additionally, an orbit jitter source was identified and has been removed, which halved the orbit jitter power at ATF2 and shows that the feed-forward scheme is also very useful for the detection of installation issues. We believe that the presented mitigation method has the potential to reduce costs and improve the performance of linear colliders and potentially other linear accelerators.},

The beam data are compared with results from a realistic RHIC model, which includes measured field errors in the magnets, and simulates operational effects and corrections. A control room application has been developed for the RHIC run 2003 that allows faster measurements of non-linear effects, online plotting and fitting of non-linear terms from measurements of tune shift as a function of orbit bump amplitude.

Various models have been proposed which improve over the GN model accuracy. One of them is the EGN model, which completely removes the Gaussianity approximation from all non-linear interference (NLI) components. The EGN model is, however, substantially more complex than the GN model. Recently, we proposed a simple closed-form formula which permits to approximate the EGN model, starting from the GN. It was however limited to all-identical, equispaced channels, and did not correct single-channel NLI (also called SCI). In this follow-up contribution, we propose an improved version which both allows to address non-identical channels and corrects the SCI contribution as well. Extensive simulative testing shows the new formula to be asymptotically very accurate, for sufficiently large number of spans. This is a preliminary document which will be followed by a journal submission.},

	abstract = {The crystal-based primary collimators installed in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN use the channelling process in bent crystals to steer halo particles efficiently onto downstream collimators. This scheme, called crystal collimation, is also considered for applications of fixed-target implementations in the context of the Physics Beyond Collider at the LHC. Crystal collimation uses 4 mm-long silicon crystals that need to be approached very close to the high-intensity circulating beams, posing obvious concerns for machine impedance. A complex mechanical assembly was developed for this purpose. The setup includes also a system to control with sub-μrad accuracy the angular orientation of the crystal, which is done with a high-precision interferometric system. In order to prevent possible beam-induced instabilities and/or damage of the device components from excessive RF-heating, the electromagnetic (EM) characterization of this device is essential prior to its usage with high-intensity beams. In this article, the longitudinal impedance of the crystal primary collimator is studied extensively and estimations of power loss inside the device are provided for the different beam types planned at the LHC and at its High-Luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). Electromagnetic simulations are performed on a realistic model that includes all the relevant components. The model is described in detail and computational challenges coming from its complexity are discussed. Care is taken to characterize the materials of each relevant sub-component. In particular, the lossy properties of silicon, whose complex permittivity is also evaluated through RF rectangular-cavity perturbation measurements, are taken into account. Numerical results are then compared with dedicated RF measurements performed on a prototype built for the LHC.},

	abstract = {Electrons lenses produce a high-intensity electron beam and have a variety of applications to circular hadron accelerators. Electron beams of different transverse cross sections and distributions may be designed, depending on the desired application, and they are produced and steered along the orbit of the hadron beam, overlapping with it for typical distances of a few meters before being deflected away and disposed of. Hollow electron beams find applications to high-intensity beam collimation for machines like the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Such devices can be integrated in a collimation system to improve the halo-cleaning performance through an active control of the halo dynamics: the annular distribution of the electrons excites resonantly the beam tails surrounding the beam core, while the core itself remains unperturbed, as ideally it only “sees” the field-free “hole” in the electron distribution. Hollow electron lenses are part of the upgrade baseline of the High-Luminosity project of the LHC (HL-LHC) and will be installed in the machine during a long shutdown in 2025– 2027 to mitigate effects from beam losses so to improve the collimation system performance. This paper describes the hollow electron lens project within the HL-LHC collimation upgrade.},

For this purpose the Metrology Light Source is ideally suited, as it is the first light source designed with the ability to adjust the three leading orders of the momentum compaction factor by quadrupole, sextupole and octupole magnets. Therefore, new opportunities to shape the longitudinal phase space arise. Focus will be put on beam dynamics dominated by nonlinear momentum compaction, in particular the generation of a new bucket type – “α-buckets” – and possible applications. Relation of analytical theory, numerical simulations and experimental data will be presented and discussed. In addition, the current limitation due to the bursting instability at the Metrology Light Source bunches will be investigated. The majority of measurements were conducted at the Metrology Light Source complemented by measurements at the BESSY II storage ring.},

	abstract = {The ever increasing demands placed upon machine performance have resulted in the need for more comprehensive particle accelerator modeling. Computer simulations are key to the success of particle accelerators. Many aspects of particle accelerators rely on computer modeling at some point, sometimes requiring complex simulation tools and massively parallel supercomputing. Examples include the modeling of beams at extreme intensities and densities (toward the quantum degeneracy limit), and with ultra-fine control (down to the level of individual particles). In the future, adaptively tuned models might also be relied upon to provide beam measurements beyond the resolution of existing diagnostics. Much time and effort has been put into creating accelerator software tools, some of which are highly successful. However, there are also shortcomings such as the general inability of existing software to be easily modified to meet changing simulation needs. In this paper possible mitigating strategies are discussed for issues faced by the accelerator community as it endeavors to produce better and more comprehensive modeling tools. This includes lack of coordination between code developers, lack of standards to make codes portable and/or reusable, lack of documentation, among others.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses measurements on the stabilization of single bunches with second order chromaticity (Q\$''\$) in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Q\$''\$ introduces an incoherent betatron tune spread which can produce Landau damping of transverse instabilities. Although the resulting stabilizing effect is similar to that provided by Landau octupoles, the underlying beam dynamics are different. Since the tune spread from Q\$''\$ is based on the longitudinal rather than the transverse action of the particles, it will not be affected by the smaller transverse emittance beams of future machines, such as the High Luminosity LHC or the Future Circular Collider, and may hence provide more efficient Landau damping than magnetic octupoles. This study serves as a proof-of-principle experiment to demonstrate Landau damping from detuning with longitudinal action by means of Q\$''\$ in a carefully prepared and well-understood accelerator environment. The agreement between measurements and pyheadtail tracking simulations shows that Q\$''\$ indeed contributes to the beam stability, that the numerical model of the LHC is accurate, and that the involved beam dynamics mechanisms are understood from both the single- and multiparticle effects points of view. The results also serve as a first experimental validation of the recently proposed radio frequency quadrupole for Landau damping., This article appears in the following collection:},

	abstract = {This MD is a follow-up study of MD1831, where single bunches were stabilized against impedance-driven instabilities at 6.5 TeV in the LHC with Q”. The goals are (i) to explore whether an amplitude detuning free Q” knob can be implemented at injection energy, and (ii) whether Q” can provide beam stability at injection, where the beams suffer mostly from electron cloud effects. Ideally, this would relax the use of the Landau octupoles and may help in preserving the beam quality by reducing dynamic aperture limitations originating from the octupoles. The MD has been split into two parts: First, optics corrections were put in place to minimize beta-beating and linear coupling introduced by the knobs. The corrections were achieved by means of orbit bumps and skew quadrupole knobs. Machine safety was then validated with loss maps. While the betatron loss maps were approved, the off-momentum maps showed a priori unexpected losses in several arcs and the MD was stopped at this point for reasons of machine protection. The second part of the MD, where the effect of Q” in terms of the mitigation of collective effects was meant to be studied, could hence not be performed and may be addressed in a future MD.},

	abstract = {The school held in Glumslov is the third CERN Accelerator School (CAS) dedicated to vacuum, after those in Platja de Aro (ES, 2006) and Snekersten (DK, 1999); its main aim was to provide new generation of ex-perts with a detailed update on `Vacuum for Particle Accelerators' with focus on materials and methods. Even though the content of the three schools is comparable, the last had a completely new format. It was longer, ten days instead of a week, and integrated practical works on five essential subjects for vacuum technology: Monte-Carlo simulation, impedance calculation, vacuum mechanics, leak detection, and residual gas analysis. The students were divided in five groups; each group participated in all practical training; and a final assessment was presented on the last days of the event by each group. The maximum number of participants was limited to 74 students by the available infrastructure; unfortunately, several requests of enrolment could not be accepted. Six grants were kindly offered by industrial sponsors and, among them, four for students of CERN non-Members States. Thirty-six lecturers and practical-work assistants conveyed their enthusiasm and state-of-the-art experience in vacuum technology and its impact on acceleration operation. The quality of the teaching and practical work is the result of the wise advice that the International Programme Committee had been given during the year-long preparation. The hands-on training needed the transport of several vacuum set-ups, com- puters, and instrumentation from Geneva to Glumslöv; a fully charged lorry was necessary. However, a small detail was forgotten: the hotel was not equipped with a forklift. It was only thanks to the remarkable local organizing committee, in particular Carolina Ingvander and Karolin Lundberg, and their persuasive action that we could unload the lorry with the help of a local farmer armed with a tractor normally used for hay-ball transport. Among the visits in the local area, the most remarkable was the one at MAX IV, a brand-new synchrotron radiation facility that adopted innovative solutions for the vacuum system of the 3-GeV storage ring. Eshraq Al Dmour, Marek Grabski and Pedro Fernandes Tavares guided the students along the impressive accelerator, one of the most ambitious European scientific infrastructures. The organisation of the school was flawless thanks to the experienced support of Roger Bailey, Werner Herr and Barbara Strasser, the missed “last CAS dinosaur” as she referred to herself. We welcomed the presence of Delphine Rivoiron for her first of a long series CAS. The Baltic See and its rapidly changing colours, the gentle hills of the Skå ne County, and professionalism of many people, including the farmer, contributed to the success of this school. Finally, at the end, everybody agreed that we could not wait again 11 years to share our passion for vacuum technology at CAS},

A wide range of particle beams have been accelerated with linacs including beams of electrons, positrons, protons, antiprotons, and heavy ions. Linac parameter possibilities include pulsed versus continuous wave, low and high beam powers, low and high repetition rates, low transverse emittance beams, short bunches with small energy spreads, and accelerated multiple bunches in a single pulse. The number of linacs around the world has grown tremendously with thousands of linacs in present use, many for medical therapy, in industry, and for research and development in a broad spectrum of scientific fields. Researchers have developed accelerators for scientific tools in their own right, being awarded several Nobel prizes. Moreover, linacs and particle accelerators in general have enabled many discovery level science experiments in related fields, resulting in many Nobel prizes as well.},

In both rings, a factor of 2 or better reduction of beta-beat was achieved within available beam time. At the same time, a new scheme of using horizontal closed orbit bump at sextupoles to correct beta-beat in the arcs was demonstrated in the Yellow ring of RHIC at beam energy of 255 GeV, and a peak beta-beat of approximately 7\% was achieved.},

During the LHC Run 2, local linear coupling in the interaction regions (IR) was shown to have a significant impact on the beam size, making its proper handling a necessity for Run 3 and the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). A new approach to accurately minimise the local IR linear coupling based on correlated external variables such as the {\textbar}C-{\textbar} had been proposed, which relies on the application of a rigid waist shift in order to create an asymmetry in the IR optics. In this contribution, preliminary corrections from the 2021 beam test and the early 2022 commissioning are presented, as well as first results of the new method's experimental configuration tests in the LHC Run 3 commissioning.},

To test the aforementioned hypothesis, some reasonable assumptions are made on BPM measurements and several calculations are derived from distribution properties underlying to these measurements. These were then applied to BPM data from the LHC Run II. The results proved the above hypothesis, showing a strong dependence of the measurements' accuracy on BPM types and their β-functions.

A measurement of the machine nonlinearities can be obtained by characterizing the amplitude detuning: the dependency of the tune as a function of the amplitude of particle oscillations.

This study aims to investigate the hypothesis of the sextupolar amplitude detuning exhibiting similar behavior to that of octupolar amplitude detuning.

	abstract = {INFN is developing at the LASA lab (Milano, Italy) the High Order (HO) corrector magnets for the High Luminosity-LHC (HL-LHC) project, which will equip the interaction regions. Five prototypes, from skew quadrupole to dodecapole, have been designed and tested at LASA. All the HO correctors are based on a superferric design, which allows a relatively simple, modular, and easy to construct magnet. This modularity has been exploited for an engineering change request. The tradeoff between safe handling, force management during cooldown, powering and protection of the magnet is explained in detail. The design of the coils and the mechanical assembly have been improved to increase the efficiency of the series production. Most of the optimizations are aimed to guarantee both a good integration in the LHC framework (i.e., radiation hardness, easiness of installation, safe operation over years), and compatibility with the series production (i.e., standardization of procedures and components for different magnets, reduction of the number of components, standardization of the quality control systems and acceptance tests). All of the produced magnets will be tested at LASA and then delivered to CERN. The design of the test-bed and the optimization of cryogenic and testing procedures is also described in this paper. Following the completion of the prototyping phase, we report in detail the solutions chosen for the HO correctors and we give a perspective of the series construction in industry and acceptance tests at LASA.},

In order to counteract disturbances due to magnetic imperfections, misalignments, ground motion, temperature changes and other dynamic effects, fully automated control of the key beam parameters â orbit, tune, coupling, chromaticity and energy â becomes an increasingly important aspect of accelerator operation.

	abstract = {Modern colliders bring into collision a large number of bunches to achieve a high luminosity. The long-range beam-beam effects arising from parasitic encounters at such colliders are mitigated by introducing a crossing angle. Under these conditions, crab cavities (CC) can be used to restore effective head-on collisions and thereby to increase the geometric luminosity. Such crab cavities have been proposed for both linear and circular colliders. The crab cavities are rf cavities operated in a transverse dipole mode, which imparts on the beam particles a transverse kick that varies with the longitudinal position along the bunch. The use of crab cavities in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may not only raise the luminosity, but it could also complicate the beam dynamics, e.g., crab cavities might not only cancel synchrobetatron resonances excited by the crossing angle but they could also excite new ones, they could reduce the dynamic aperture for off-momentum particles, they could influence the aperture and orbit, also degrade the collimation cleaning efficiency, and so on. In this paper, we explore the principal feasibility of LHC crab cavities from a beam dynamics point of view. The implications of the crab cavities for the LHC optics, analytical and numerical luminosity studies, dynamic aperture, aperture and beta beating, emittance growth, beam-beam tune shift, long-range collisions, and synchrobetatron resonances, crab dispersion, and collimation efficiency will be discussed.},

	abstract = {The High Luminosity LHC Project target is to reach an integrated luminosity of the LHC of 3000 fb-1, corresponding to a factor 10 increase in collisions with respect to the current accelerator. One of the main components is the superconducting quadrupole called MQXF. It is based on Nb3Sn technology and has a 150 mm single aperture with a field gradient of 132.6 T/m. The MQXF magnets are currently in preseries production in a joint collaboration between CERN and the US-LHC Accelerator Upgrade Project (AUP). The first prototype magnet based on 7-m-long coils (MQXFBP1) was assembled and preloaded in 2019. The testing and disassembly was done in 2020. The coils were equipped with optical Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. Some of the FBG values exhibited strain jumps during preload and their signals were lost during cool-down. The magnet did not reach the nominal current, quenching at 15.15 kA. At the time of writing three MQXFB magnets have been preloaded from which the second prototype is soon to be tested. The objective of this paper is to analyze the mechanical behaviour of MQXFB magnets in the light of current knowledge, thanks to earlier short model experiments, as well as describe in detail the process of assembly and preload. We synthesize the mechanical theory of preload and present new considerations on symmetric/asymmetric bladder-key operations and their effects. An extensive comparison between long and short model magnets is presented. In our analysis and FE modeling we take into account the measured coil sizes that vary over position. We introduce a novel technique that allows preload homogenization over the length of the magnet after preload has been done. We analyze the role of the stainless steel shell and show its mechanical behaviour. Finally, the relevant data at cold is presented and analyzed.},

	abstract = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16 × 16 × 26 m3 with a total weight of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, with the exception of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.},

	abstract = {The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 1034 cm-2 s-1 (1027 cm-2 s-1). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4π solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values ({\textbar}η{\textbar} \${\textbackslash}leqslant\$ 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.},

It aims to achieve a record high luminosity of 8× 1035 cm-2 s-1, for which accurate control of \${\textbackslash}beta\_{\textbackslash}ast\$y is needed. The advanced final focus system is also relevant for studies related to future linear colliders, which similarly need to achieve very small beam sizes. To work for SuperKEKB, the K modulation technique is generalized to allow known quadrupole fields between the modulated magnets and the interaction point. Initial measurements taken in HER agree with simulations, and show that K modulation is suitable for measuring the minimum of the β function at the interaction point within 1\%, however it is too uncertain to be used for measuring the displacement of the beam waist away from the interaction point. In addition, tune shift equations for a modulated quadrupole are derived without assuming a thin lens perturbation, giving a simple method to calculate the tune shift to second order in the quadrupole strength modulation.},

	abstract = {After two years of shutdown, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operated in 2015 at an energy of 6.5 TeV. In this paper, we give the first outlook of the behavior of the LHC magnets operating at this field level, corresponding to 8-T peak field in the main dipoles. The main magnetic features are reconstructed through the beam measurements, mainly the tune (quadrupolar components) and the chromaticity (sextupolar components). The decay and snapback at injection and the start of the ramp are expected to increase by 50\% due to the higher operational current. The behavior at high field will be affected by the saturation components, which were barely visible in one magnet family in the 4-TeV runs and totally invisible in the rest. Although the initial plan aims at a rather conservative value of β*, during the squeeze, the triplet and matching section quadrupole will become important. Beam measurements will provide interesting information about the magnetic behavior of these quadrupoles; in particular, through beta beating, we will estimate the absolute precision of the knowledge of the quadrupole strength. The statistics of the beam measurements will be rather limited in the first stages of commissioning, but should already reveal the main features of the 6.5-TeV operation.},

	abstract = {Recent observations in the LHC point to the existence of an amplitude dependent closest tune approach. However this dynamical behavior and its underlying mechanism remain unknown. This effect is highly relevant for the LHC as an unexpected closest tune approach varying with amplitude modifies the frequency content of the beam and, hence, the Landau damping. Furthermore the single particle stability would also be affected by this effect as it would modify how particles with varying amplitudes approach and cross resonances. We present analytic derivations that lead to a mechanism generating an amplitude dependent closest tune approach.},

Its performance is tested using the dynamic aperture as a figure of merit.

Therefore the ac dipole seems to be an adequate tool for nonlinear diagnostics provided the particle motion is well described in the presence of the ac dipole and nonlinearities. Normal forms and Lie algebra are powerful tools to study the nonlinear content of an accelerator lattice. In this article a way to obtain the normal form of the Hamiltonian of an accelerator with an ac dipole is described. The particle motion to first order in the nonlinearities is derived using Lie algebra techniques. The dependence of the Hamiltonian terms on the longitudinal coordinate is studied showing that they vary differently depending on the ac dipole parameters.

To conclude it is proposed to modify the existing Beam 2 knobs for 2012 to achieve the best possible performance.},

These powerful tools have been applied also to the domain of high-energy physics, in the analysis of the data from particle collisions, for years already.

Several activities are flourishing in this domain, in view of providing new insights to beam dynamics in circular accelerators, in different laboratories worldwide. This is, for instance, the case for the CERN Large Hadron Collider, where since a few years exploratory studies are being carried out. A broad range of topics have been addressed, such as anomaly detection of beam position monitors, analysis of optimal correction tools for linear optics, optimisation of the collimation system, lifetime and performance optimisation, and detection of hidden correlations in the huge data set of beam dynamics observables collected during the LHC Run 2. Furthermore, very recently, machine learning techniques are being scrutinised for the advanced analysis of numerical simulations data, in view of improving our models of dynamic aperture evolution.},

	abstract = {In response to recommendations in the 2013 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics, a conceptual design effort for an energy upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the so-called high-energy LHC (HE-LHC), was launched as part of the Future Circular Collider study. The HE-LHC machine, which is meant to use 16 T magnet technologies in the existing LHC tunnel, would provide proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 27 TeV (\${\textbackslash}sim\$2× LHC) with a total stored energy of 1.34 GJ (\${\textbackslash}sim\$4× LHC) per beam. By adapting the LHC collimation system, a first layout of the HE-LHC's betatron cleaning insertion was conceived, with the requirement to sustain— for at least 10 seconds— the impact of about 1.86 MW, corresponding to a beam lifetime of 12 minutes, without inducing any magnet quench nor any damage to other accelerator components. In this article, we evaluate the power deposition on the collimation insertion for proton beam operation in the HE-LHC machine at top energy, by means of particle tracking and interaction calculations. The beam loss effects on the warm elements as well as on the superconducting dispersion suppressor magnets are assessed through a three-step simulation approach. In particular, for the proposed future high-energy LHC, we demonstrate the necessity of adding local collimators in the dispersion suppressor, and we uncover the harmful consequences of a potential removal of the beam line “dogleg” in the collimation insertion.},

	abstract = {The LHC is now operating with a tune separation of \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.004 in collision. This puts tight constraints on the allowed transverse coupling since a {\textbar}C-{\textbar} larger than a fraction of the fractional tune split may lead to beam instabilities. In the last years a new tool based on the ADT used in a similar way as an AC-dipole to excite the beam was developed. The ADT AC-dipole gives coherent oscillations without increasing the beam emittance. These oscillations are analyzed automatically to obtain the value of the coupling. A coupling measurement campaign was done in 2017 and while the correction converged and stayed rather constant over time it was observed that depending on the target bunch and filling scheme the results could vary by Δ{\textbar}C-{\textbar} \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 0.002. In this MD report we investigated 3 different bunches, one with Long Range Beam-Beam (LRBB) in IPs 1 and 5, one with LRBB in all IPs and one with no LRBB. The results indicate that there are differences in coupling between the bunches experiencing different LRBB. Furthermore, there is also a measurable difference in the tunes between the different bunches. A measurement of the emittance also shows that there is no observable increase of emittance from these measurement techniques},

The peak proton performance exceeded twice the design luminosity thanks to very small transverse beam emittances and beta* of 30 cm. The nominal bunch spacing of 25 ns was used for high intensity operation, initially with the standard 25 ns beam and from 2016 onwards with BCMS and 8b4e beams. New features such as combined ramp and squeeze, crossing angle and levelling as well as ATS optics (Achromatic Telescopic Squeeze) were introduced in regular operation between 2016 and 2018. Lead ion, mixed proton-lead, intermediate proton energy, vdm calibration and high-beta runs were also performed with a large diversity of configurations and beam energies. This note summarizes LHC operation during Run 2 and documents in detail the congurations and performances achieved for the various operation modes.},

	abstract = {In circular machines, nonlinear dynamics can impact parameters such as beam lifetime and could result in limitations on the performance reach of the accelerator. Assessing and understanding these effects in experiments is essential to confirm the accuracy of the magnetic model and improve the machine performance. A direct measurement of the machine nonlinearities can be obtained by characterizing the dependency of the tune as a function of the amplitude of oscillations (usually defined as amplitude detuning). The conventional technique is to excite the beam to large amplitudes with a single kick and derive the tune from turn-by-turn data acquired with beam position monitors. Although this provides a very precise tune measurement it has the significant disadvantage of being destructive. An alternative, nondestructive way of exciting large amplitude oscillations is to use an ac dipole. The perturbation Hamiltonian in the presence of an ac dipole excitation shows a distinct behavior compared to the free oscillations which should be correctly taken into account in the interpretation of experimental data. The use of an ac dipole for direct amplitude detuning measurement requires careful data processing allowing one to observe the natural tune of the machine; the feasibility of such a measurement is demonstrated using experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider. An experimental proof of the theoretical derivations based on measurements performed at injection energy is provided as well as an application of this technique at top energy using a large number of excitations on the same beam.},

Based on a high-resolution bunch-by-bunch three-dimensional measurement system, a noninvasive measurement of momentum compaction factor and the dispersion function was performed at the Shanghai synchrotron radiation facility (SSRF). The dispersion function can be obtained purely from the direct observation results of the bunch-by bunch 3D position, based on the definition of the dispersion function during normal user operation run without perturbing the beam. The theoretical background and experimental results of the method are discussed in this paper. The measurement results are in good agreement with the design values.},

At KEKB, CCs have exhibited abrupt changes of phase and voltage during a time period of the order of a few LHC turns and considering the significant stored energy in the HL-LHC beam, CC failures represent a serious threat in regard to LHC machine protection. In this paper, we discuss the effect of CC voltage or phase changes on a time interval similar to, or longer than, the one needed to dump the beam. The simulations assume a quasistationary-state distribution to assess the particles losses for the HL-LHC. These distributions produce beam losses below the safe operation threshold for Gaussian tails, while, for non-Gaussian tails are on the same order of the limit. Additionally, some mitigation strategies are studied for reducing the damage caused by the CC failures.},

This technique only requires the knowledge of the envelope of the equalized signal before phase correction, which can be achieved by using any two arbitrary statistical moments, and it is suitable for both constant and non-constant modulus modulation formats. The proposed estimation method is experimentally demonstrated for 10-Gbaud pol-mux coherent systems using QPSK and 16-QAM. Additionally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate 20-Gbaud systems using 16-QAM and 64-QAM. The results show that the OSNR can be estimated accurately over a wide range of values for QPSK, 16-QAM or 64-QAM systems up to 1920-km long and with up to 50-ps all-order polarization mode dispersion. By setting a proper reference value for calibration, the proposed algorithm also shows good tolerance when the received signal is not well compensated.},

	url = {http://cds.cern.ch/record/883298},
	abstract = {The fractional part of the tune value of a circular accelerator can be measured by observing the betatron oscillations of the beam on a position sensitive pick-up. In the frequency domain the betatron signal is seen as sidebands on the revolution harmonics. The bunches in the beam often have a very short length with respect to the revolution period, resulting in a wideband pick-up signal spectrum, containing many betatron lines. Classical tune measurement systems filter out just one or a few of these betatron sidebands. As a consequence, most of the betatron energy is lost and only a very small fraction remains for further processing. This paper describes a new method, referred to as Direct Diode Detection (3D), which overcomes this and a few other problems. The basic idea is to time stretch the beam pulses from the pick up in order to increase the betatron frequency content in the baseband. This can be accomplished by a simple diode detector followed by an RC low pass filter, as used in the common envelope detection technique for demodulating AM signals. It will be shown that such a circuit can increase the betatron signal level by orders of magnitude compared to classical systems. The 3D method was recently tested in the CERN SPS and PS machines with prototype base band tune (BBQ) measurement systems. Results will be presented showing that the prototypes were sensitive enough to see betatron oscillations in both machines with no added external excitation. The SPS system is also shown to be capable of measuring tunes with a resolution of 10-5 with no explicit excitation. Copies of the BBQ prototype are currently being tested on BNL-RHIC and FNAL-Tevatron as part of the US LARP collaboration, with a view to installing a similar system for tune measurement at the LHC},

This extension, named Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), improves the consistency and reliability of the anomaly score produced for a given data point. We show that the standard Isolation Forest produces inconsistent scores using score maps. The score maps suffer from an artifact generated as a result of how the criteria for branching operation of the binary tree is selected. We propose two different approaches for improving the situation. First we propose transforming the data randomly before creation of each tree, which results in averaging out the bias introduced in the algorithm. Second, which is the preferred way, is to allow the slicing of the data to use hyperplanes with random slopes. This approach results in improved score maps. We show that the consistency and reliability of the algorithm is much improved using this method by looking at the variance of scores of data points distributed along constant score lines. We find no appreciable difference in the rate of convergence nor in computation time between the standard Isolation Forest and EIF, which highlights its potential as anomaly detection algorithm.},

The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},

	abstract = {The non-linear beam dynamics of a circular accelerator, such as the Large Hadron Collider, can have a significant impact on its operation. In order to avoid limitations on the performance reach of the accelerator, and ensure machine protection, it is vital that the beam dynamics are well understood and controlled. This thesis presents the results of studies of non-linear beam dynamics undertaken on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, during the 2010 to 2013 period. It sets out to quantify the understanding of the non-linear beam dynamics through the comparison of beam-based measurements to simulation, and where able and appropriate seeks to explain deviations of measurement from the model, and define corrections for relevant aspects of the dynamics. The analyses presented in this thesis represent considerable advances in the understanding of the LHC beam dynamics which should allow for an improved operation of the machine in the coming years.},

This precise technique can be applied to the nonlinear lattice correction as well. The betatron phase probed by an off-axis beam provides information on the sextupole strength. In comparison with the model the nominal strength can be restored. It was shown that the proposed scheme treated all the leading order resonance driving terms generated by sextupoles, as well as the detuning terms and the nonlinear chromaticity. At NSLS-II a half percent sextupole correction led to a 15\% increase of the dynamic aperture.},

By using the more powerful Lie algebra and the resonance driving terms formalism, equivalent formulas are derived that provide a better understanding of some counterintuitive effects, otherwise not understandable in the smooth approximation.

Here, we describe an oligonucleotide synthesis strategy that uses the template-independent polymerase terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Each TdT molecule is conjugated to a single deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) molecule that it can incorporate into a primer. After incorporation of the tethered dNTP, the 3′ end of the primer remains covalently bound to TdT and is inaccessible to other TdT–dNTP molecules. Cleaving the linkage between TdT and the incorporated nucleotide releases the primer and allows subsequent extension. We demonstrate that TdT–dNTP conjugates can quantitatively extend a primer by a single nucleotide in 10–20 s, and that the scheme can be iterated to write a defined sequence. This approach may form the basis of an enzymatic oligonucleotide synthesizer.},

	url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/2265177},
	abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is currently the world's largest particle accelerator with the highest center of mass energy in particle collision experiments. The control of the particle beam focusing is essential for the performance reach of such an accelerator. For the characterization of the focusing properties at the LHC, turn-by-turn beam position data is simultaneously recorded at numerous measurement devices (BPMs) along the accelerator, while an oscillation is excited on the beam. A novel analysis method for these measurements (\$N\$-BPM method) is developed here, which is based on a detailed analysis of systematic and statistical error sources and their correlations. It has been applied during the commissioning of the LHC for operation at an unprecedented energy of 6.5 TeV. In this process a stronger focusing than its design specifications has been achieved. This results in smaller transverse beam sizes at the collision points and allows for a higher rate of particle collisions. For the derivation of the focusing parameters at many synchrotron light sources, the change of the beam orbit is observed, which is induced by deliberate changes of magnetic fields (orbit response matrix). In contrast, the analysis of turn-by-turn beam position measurements is for many of these machines less precise due to the distance between two BPMs. The \$N\$-BPM method overcomes this limitation by allowing to include the measurement data from more BPMs in the analysis. It has been applied at the ALBA synchrotron light source and compared to the orbit response method. The significantly faster measurement with the \$N\$-BPM method is a considerable advantage in this case.  Finally, an outlook is given to the challenges which lie ahead for the control of the beam focusing at the HL-LHC, which is a future major upgrade of the LHC.},

Additionally, averaging techniques to reduce noise on beam position data, which allows precise estimates of equivalent kicks, are presented and mathematically justified. The complete procedure is tested with simulated data obtained from madx and 2015-LHC experimental data. The analyses performed in the experimental data indicate that the strengths of the IR skew quadrupole correctors and normal quadrupole correctors can be estimated within a 10\% uncertainty.

To recover head-on collisions at the high-luminosity particle-physics detectors ATLAS and CMS and benefit from the very low β∗ provided by the Achromatic Telescopic Squeezing (ATS) optics, a local crab cavity scheme provides transverse kicks to the proton bunches. The tight space constraints at the location of these cavities leads to designs which are axially non-symmetric, giving rise to high order multipoles components of the main deflecting mode and, since these kicks are harmonic in time, we expand them in a series of multipoles in a similar fashion as is done for static field magnets. In this work we calculate, for the first time, the higher order multipoles and their impact on beam dynamics for three different crab cavity prototypes. Different approaches to calculate the multipoles are presented. Furthermore, we perform the first calculation of their impact on the long term stability of the machine using the concept of dynamic aperture.},

The linearized approximation is not valid for a variety of interesting systems, nor is it simple to extend to higher order. It is also well-known that the linearized approximation to the Vlasov equation is invalid for long times, due to its inability to correctly capture fine phase space structures. We derive a perturbation theory for the Vlasov equation based on the underlying Hamiltonian structure of the phase space evolution. We obtain an explicit perturbation series for a dressed Hamiltonian applicable to arbitrary systems whose dynamics can be described by the nonlinear Vlasov equation.},

The basic principles of the ATS scheme will be reminded together with its basic motivation which is to deliver a very ambitious β* of 10-15 cm in view of the even more ambitious performance commitments taken by the HL-LHC project. In this context, a few dedicated beam experiments were meticulously prepared and took place at the LHC in 2011. The results obtained will be highlighted, demonstrating already the viability of the scheme. The plans for 2012 will be discussed, with a few optics considerations which could already justify the implementation of the ATS scheme in the nominal machine, depending on which β* limits will be met first, and that the ATS can solve (e.g. optics matchability, chromatic aberrations) and obviously cannot: the aperture of the existing triplet.},

The correction algorithm is based on the minimization of the differences between the IR transfer map with errors and the design IR transfer map. Its performance is tested using the dynamic aperture as a figure of merit. The relation between map coefficients and resonance terms is also given as a way to target particular resonances by selecting the right map coefficients.

The quality of the coupling measurements is increased, with about a factor 3, by selecting beam position monitor (BPM) pairs with phase advances close to π2 and through data cleaning using singular value decomposition with an optimal number of singular values. These improvements are beneficial for the implemented automatic coupling correction, which is based on injection oscillations, presented in the article. Furthermore, a proposed coupling feedback for the LHC is presented. The system will rely on the measurements from BPMs equipped with a new type of high resolution electronics, diode orbit and oscillation, which will be operational when the LHC restarts in 2015. The feedback will combine the coupling measurements from the available BPMs in order to calculate the best correction.},

	abstract = {Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed—either explicitly or implicitly—to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, robustness, and/or speed. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis. The specific benefits of randomized techniques depend on the computational environment. Consider the model problem of finding the k dominant components of the singular value decomposition of an \$m {\textbackslash}times n\$ matrix. (i) For a dense input matrix, randomized algorithms require \${\textbackslash}bigO(mn {\textbackslash}log(k))\$ floating-point operations (flops) in contrast to \$ {\textbackslash}bigO(mnk)\$ for classical algorithms. (ii) For a sparse input matrix, the flop count matches classical Krylov subspace methods, but the randomized approach is more robust and can easily be reorganized to exploit multiprocessor architectures. (iii) For a matrix that is too large to fit in fast memory, the randomized techniques require only a constant number of passes over the data, as opposed to \${\textbackslash}bigO(k)\$ passes for classical algorithms. In fact, it is sometimes possible to perform matrix approximation with a single pass over the data.},

	abstract = {ac dipoles in accelerators are used to excite coherent betatron oscillations at a drive frequency close to the tune. These beam oscillations may last arbitrarily long and, in principle, there is no significant emittance growth if the ac dipole is adiabatically turned on and off. Therefore the ac dipole seems to be an adequate tool for nonlinear diagnostics provided the particle motion is well described in the presence of the ac dipole and nonlinearities. Normal forms and Lie algebra are powerful tools to study the nonlinear content of an accelerator lattice. In this article a way to obtain the normal form of the Hamiltonian of an accelerator with an ac dipole is described. The particle motion to first order in the nonlinearities is derived using Lie algebra techniques. The dependence of the Hamiltonian terms on the longitudinal coordinate is studied showing that they vary differently depending on the ac dipole parameters. The relation is given between the lines of the Fourier spectrum of the turn-by-turn motion and the Hamiltonian terms.},

	title = {Studies and measurements of linear coupling and nonlinearities in hadron circular accelerators},
	url = {https://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/frontdoor/index/index/year/2006/docId/2270},
	abstract = {In this thesis a beam-based method has been developed to measure the strength and the polarity of corrector magnets (skew quadrupoles and sextupoles) in circular accelerators. The algorithm is based on the harmonic analysis (via FFT) of beam position monitor (BPM) data taken turn by turn from an accelerator in operation. It has been shown that, from the differences of the spectral line amplitudes between two consecutive BPMs, both the strength and the polarity of non-linear elements placed in between can be measured. The method has been successfully tested using existing BPM data from the SPS of CERN, since presently the SIS-18 is not equipped with the necessary hardware. The magnet strength of seven SPS extraction sextupoles was measured with a precision of about 10\%. The polarities have been unambiguously measured. This method can be used to detect polarity errors and wrong power supply connections during machine commissioning, as well as for a continuous monitoring of the "nonlinearity budget" in superconducting machines. A second beam-based method has been studied for a fast measurement and correction of betatron coupling driven by skew quadrupole field errors and tilted focusing quadrupoles. Traditional methods usually require a time-consuming scan of the corrector magnets in order to minimize the coupling stop band {\textbar}C{\textbar}. In this thesis it has been shown how the same correction can be performed in a single machine cycle from the harmonic analysis of multi-BPM data. The method has been successfully applied to RHIC. It has been shown that the stop band {\textbar}C{\textbar} (also known in the American literature as Delta-Qmin) measured in a single machine cycle with the new algorithm is compatible with the value obtained by traditional methods. The measurement of the resonance phase Theta defines automatically the best corrector setting, which was found in agreement with the one obtained with a traditional scan. A third theoretical achievement is a new description of the betatron motion close to the difference resonance in presence of linear coupling. Compared to the matrix formalism the motion is parametrized as a function of the resonance driving term f1001 only (which is proven to be an observable), whereas making use of the matrix approach four parameters need to be measured. Formulae describing the exchange of RMS emittances when approaching the resonances have been already derived in the 70s in the smooth approximation. New formulae have been derived here making use of Lie algebra providing a better description of the emittance behavior. The emittance exchange curves are predicted by new formulae with excellent agreement with multi-particle simulations and the counter-intuitive emittance variation along the ring of the emittance is proven to be related to the variation of f1001. A new way to decouple the equations of motion and explicit expressions for the individual single particle invariants have been found. For the first time emittance exchange studies have been carried out in the SIS-18 of GSI. Transverse RMS emittances have been measured during 2005 from rest gas monitor (RGM) data. Crossing the linear coupling resonance, the transverse emittances exchange completely. It has been observed that this effect is reversible. Applications of this manipulation are: emittance equilibration under consideration for future operations of the SIS-18 as booster for the SIS-100; emittance transfer during multi-turn injection to improve the eficiency and to protect the injection septum in high intensity operations, by shifting part of the horizontal emittance into the vertical plane. The emittance exchange curves obtained experimentally have been compared with analytic formulae providing a fast measurement (in few machine cycles only) of the linear coupling stop band {\textbar}C{\textbar}. Technical problems prevented the use of the eight skew quadrupoles installed in the SIS-18 to compensate the linear coupling resonance. It has been observed that the emittance exchange curve is highly sensitive to the beam intensity. Multi-particle simulations with 2D PIC space-charge solver have been run to infer heuristic scaling laws able to quantify the observable stop band, to be used for the resonance compensation. The analysis of BPM and RGM data has been performed making use of new software applications developed for this purpose. The bpm2rdt code for the harmonic analysis of BPM data has been written and tested with real data. The software reads the BPM turn-by-turn data and the Twiss parameters. Then it performs the FFT of these data, finds the peaks of the Fourier spectra and infers the RDT fjklm, the strengths {\textasciicircum}hjklm and the local terms lambda-jklm. All these observables are printed out together with the corresponding values of the model, computed from the nominal values of strengths and the Twiss parameters. From the FFT of dual-plane BPM data the linear optics (beta functions and phase advances Delta phi) at the corresponding location is also inferred. From the measurement of f1000, the linear coupling coeffcient C (amplitude and phase) is also computed. The code has been tested by using existing SPS data and new RHIC data. For the on-line analysis of RGM data the rgm2emitt code has been written. The application reads in input the raw data files from the RGM and the beam loss monitor (BLM) respectively, the latter created by the RGM on-line software itself. From the RGM data the transverse beam sizes and emittances are inferred and used together with the BLM data to compute the tune shift during the machine cycle.},

	abstract = {The quality of optical signals is a very important parameter in optical communications. Several metrics are in common use, like optical signal-to-noise power ratio (OSNR), Q-factor, error vector magnitude (EVM) and bit error ratio (BER). A measured raw BER is not necessarily useful to predict the final BER after soft-decision forward error correction (FEC), if the statistics of the noise leading to errors is unknown. In this respect the EVM is superior, as it allows an estimation of the error statistics. We compare various metrics analytically, by simulation, and through experiments. We employ six quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) formats at symbol rates of 20 GBd and 25 GBd. The signals were generated by a software-defined transmitter. We conclude that for optical channels with additive Gaussian noise the EVM metric is a reliable quality measure. For nondata-aided QAM reception, BER in the range 10-6...10-2 can be reliably estimated from measured EVM.},

Beam-loss monitor thresholds were carefully adjusted to provide optimal protection from the multiple loss mechanisms in heavy-ion operation. A switch from a basic bunch-spacing of 100 ns to 75 ns was made as the beam became available from the injector chain. A new record luminosity, 6 times the original design and close to the operating value proposed for HL-LHC, provided validation of the strategy for mitigating quenches due to bound-free pair production (BFPP) at the interaction points of the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Most of the beam parameters of the HL-LHC Pb-Pb upgrade were attained during this run and the integrated luminosity goals for the first 10 years of LHC operation were substantially exceeded.},

	abstract = {The LHC is now operating with a tune separation of ∼0.004 in collision.

In the last years a new tool based on the ADT used in a similar way as an AC-dipole to excite the beam was developed. The ADT AC-dipole gives coherent oscillations without increasing the beam emittance. These oscillations are analyzed automatically to obtain the value of the coupling. A coupling measurement campaign was done in 2017 and while the correction converged and stayed rather constant over time it was observed that depending on the target bunch and ﬁlling scheme the results could vary by Δ{\textbar}C−{\textbar} ∼ 0.002. In this MD report we investigated 3 diﬀerent bunches, one with Long Range Beam-Beam (LRBB) in IPs 1 and 5, one with LRBB in all IPs and one with no LRBB. The results indicate that there are diﬀerences in coupling between the bunches experiencing diﬀerent LRBB. Furthermore, there is also a measurable diﬀerence in the tunes between the diﬀerent bunches. A measurement of the emittance also shows that there is no observable increase of emittance from these measurement techniques},

	abstract = {Nonlinear errors in experimental insertions can pose a signiﬁcant challenge to the operability of low-β∗ colliders. When crossing schemes are applied high-order errors, such as decapole and dodecapole multipole components in triplets and separation dipoles, can feed-down to give a normal octupole perturbation. Such ﬁelds may contribute to distortion of the assumed tune footprint, inﬂuencing lifetime and the Landau damping of instabilities. Conversely, comparison of amplitude detuning coefﬁcients with and without crossing schemes applied should allow for the beam-based study of such high-order errors.

	abstract = {The equations of motion of the particles in a synchrotron in which the field gradient index n=−(rB)∂B∂r varies along the equilibrium orbit are examined on the basis of the linear approximation. It is shown that if n alternates rapidly between large positive and large negative values, the stability of both radial and vertical oscillations can be greatly increased compared to conventional accelerators in which n is azimuthally constant and must lie between 0 and 1. Thus aperture requirements are reduced. For practical designs, the improvement is limited by the effects of constructional errors; these lead to resonance excitation of oscillations and consequent instability if 2νx or 2νz or νx + νz is integral, where νx and νz are the frequencies of horizontal and vertical betatron oscillations, measured in units of the frequency of revolution. The mechanism of phase stability is essentially the same as in a conventional synchrotron, but the radial amplitude of synchrotron oscillations is reduced substantially. Furthermore, at a “transition energy” E1 ≈ νxMc2 the stable and unstable equilibrium phases exchange roles, necessitating a jump in the phase of the radiofrequency accelerating voltage. Calculations indicate that the manner in which this jump is performed is not very critical.},

	abstract = {For many applications, the precise knowledge of the beta function at a given location is essential. Several measurement techniques for optics functions are used in the LHC to provide the most suitable method for a given scenario. A new tool to run k-modulation measurements and analysis is being developed with the aim to be fully automatic and online. It will take constraints of various systems such as tune measurement precision, powering limits of the LHC superconducting circuits and limits of their quench protection systems into account. It will also provide the possibility to sinusoidally modulate the currents of the investigated quadrupoles with a predefined frequency and amplitude to increase the measurement precision further. This paper will review the advantages and limitations of k-modulation measurements in the LHC with and without sinusoidal current modulation. The used algorithms and tools will be presented and estimates on the obtainable beta function measurement precision will be given.},

is the dynamic aperture under forced oscillation of ac dipoles. This new observable has the potential to help
characterize relative changes in the nonlinear content of the machine, improve the understanding of the
nonlinear models by comparing to simulations, validate nonlinear optics corrections, and give a qualitative
lower bound estimate on the free dynamic aperture. This paper presents the first experimental demonstration

	abstract = {Maximization of the dynamic aperture and Landau damping of the collective instabilities are partly con icting requirements. On the one hand, the non-linearities of the lattice must be minimized at large oscillation amplitude to guarantee the stability of the single particle motion. On the other hand, a spread of the betatron frequencies is needed for the stability of the collective motion of bunches of particles this requires non-linearities e ective at small amplitudes. We show in this note that the `natural' spread of betatron tunes due to the eld imperfections is inadequate for Landau damping. An octupole scheme is required to provide collective stability at high energy. At low energy it may be used to nd the optimum between the correction of the octupolar eld imperfections and Landau damping. The solution of the stability problem taking into account the two degrees of freedom of the transverse motion allows a signi cant saving in octupole strength even though a safety margin is included: 144 octupoles with a magnetic length of 32 cm are needed, leaving some reserve slots for other correctors. The present localization close to the lattice quadrupoles is well adapted for Landau damping, but unfavourable for the correction of the octupolar imperfection of the dipoles. Depending on the multipolar errors in the dipoles, octupolar and skew octupolar spool pieces may have to be envisaged.},

	abstract = {In circular machines, nonlinear dynamics can impact parameters such as beam lifetime and could result in limitations on the performance reach of the accelerator. Assessing and understanding these effects in experiments is essential to confirm the accuracy of the magnetic model and improve the machine performance. A direct measurement of the machine nonlinearities can be obtained by characterizing the dependency of the tune as a function of the amplitude of oscillations (usually defined as amplitude detuning). The conventional technique is to excite the beam to large amplitudes with a single kick and derive the tune from turn-by-turn data acquired with beam position monitors. Although this provides a very precise tune measurement it has the significant disadvantage of being destructive. An alternative, nondestructive way of exciting large amplitude oscillations is to use an ac dipole. The perturbation Hamiltonian in the presence of an ac dipole excitation shows a distinct behavior compared to the free oscillations which should be correctly taken into account in the interpretation of experimental data. The use of an ac dipole for direct amplitude detuning measurement requires careful data processing allowing one to observe the natural tune of the machine; the feasibility of such a measurement is demonstrated using experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider. An experimental proof of the theoretical derivations based on measurements performed at injection energy is provided as well as an application of this technique at top energy using a large number of excitations on the same beam.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear magnetic errors in low-β insertions can contribute significantly to detuning with amplitude, linear and nonlinear chromaticity, and lead to degradation of dynamic aperture and beam lifetime. As such, the correction of nonlinear errors in the experimental insertions of colliders can be of critical significance for successful operation. This is expected to be of particular relevance to the LHC’s second run and its high luminosity upgrade, as well as to future colliders such as the Future Circular Collider. Current correction strategies envisioned for these colliders assume it will be possible to calculate optimized local corrections through the insertions, using a magnetic model of the errors. This paper shows however, that reliance purely upon magnetic measurements of the nonlinear errors of insertion elements is insufficient to guarantee a good correction quality in the relevant low-β* regime. It is possible to perform beam-based examination of nonlinear magnetic errors via the feed-down to readily observed beam properties upon application of closed orbit bumps, and methods based upon feed-down to tune have been utilized at RHIC, SIS18, and SPS. This paper demonstrates the extension of such methodology to include direct observation of feed-down to linear coupling in the LHC. It is further shown that such beam-based studies can be used to complement magnetic measurements performed during LHC construction, in order to validate and refine the magnetic model of the collider. Results from first attempts of the measurement and correction of nonlinear errors in the LHC experimental insertions are presented. Several discrepancies of beam-based studies with respect to the LHC magnetic model are reported.},

As the LHC progresses to more challenging regimes of operation it is to be expected that the nonlinear single particle dynamics in the transverse planes will play an increasing role in limiting the reach of the accelerator. As such it is vital that the nonlinear sources are well understood. The nonlinear fields of a circular accelerator may be probed through measurement of the amplitude detuning: the variation of tune with single particle emittance. This quantity may be assessed experimentally by exciting the beam to large amplitudes with kicks, and obtaining the tunes and actions from turn-by-turn data at Beam Position Monitors. The large amplitude excitations inherent to such a measurement also facilitate measurement of the dynamic aperture from an analysis of beam losses following the kicks. In 2012 these measurements were performed on the LHC Beam 2 at injection energy (450 GeV) with the nominal magnetic configuration. Nonlinear coupling was also observed. A second set of measurements were performed following the application of corrections for b4 and b5 errors. Analysis of the experimental results, and a comparison to simulation are presented herein.},

As β∗ is reduced however, the impact of nonlinear errors in experimental insertions may become sizable. Below β∗ = 0.8 m, and in particular with possible LHC conﬁgurations approaching 0.3 m, an operational impact from uncompensated nonlinear errors in the IRs is to be expected. Notably the contribution of normal octupole errors in IR1 and IR5 to the tune footprint becomes comparable to that created by the Landau octupoles, with implications for the performance of instrumentation and Landau damping of instabilities. In the HL-LHC compensation of IR-nonlinear sources may become a critical issue, with feed-down from IR-sextupole errors having the potential to generate substantial linear optics perturbations. This effect will require an evolution of the linear optics commissioning strategy in the LHC and HL-LHC. Current understanding of the impact of these errors and our ability to correct them will be reported.

Hence, several results were available to aid comprehension of the behavior of charged particle beams under the influence of nonlinear forces. Here, we discuss how concepts derived from the theory of dynamical systems, linked with the fundamental Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theory and Nekhoroshev theorem, can be successfully applied to the analysis of nonlinear motion of charged particles in a circular accelerator.

	title = {Detailed review of the {LHC} optics commissioning for the nonlinear era},
	url = {http://cds.cern.ch/record/2655741},
	abstract = {In 2017, optics commissioning strategy for low-β∗ operation of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) underwent a major revision. This was prompted by a need to extend the scope of beam-based commissioning at high-energy, beyond the exclusively linear realm considered previously, and into the nonlinear regime. It also stemmed from a recognition that, due to operation with crossing angles in the experimental insertions, the linear and nonlinear optics quality were intrinsically linked through potentially significant feed-down at these locations. Following the usual linear optics commissioning therefore, corrections for (normal and skew) sextupole and (normal and skew) octupole errors in the high-luminosity insertions were implemented. For the first time, the LHC now operates at top-energy with beam-based corrections for nonlinear dynamics, and for the effect of the crossing-scheme on beta-beating and dispersion. The new commissioning procedure has improved the control of various linear and nonlinear characteristics of the LHC, yielding clear operational benefits. This report gives a detailed account of the beam-based measurements carried out during the experimental campaigns},

The goals are (i) to explore whether an amplitude detuning free Q'' knob can be implemented at injection energy, and (ii) whether Q'' can provide beam stability at injection, where the beams suffer mostly from electron cloud effects. Ideally, this would relax the use of the Landau octupoles and may help in preserving the beam quality by reducing dynamic aperture limitations originating from the octupoles. The MD has been split into two parts: First, optics corrections were put in place to minimize beta-beating and linear coupling introduced by the knobs. The corrections were achieved by means of orbit bumps and skew quadrupole knobs. Machine safety was then validated with loss maps. While the betatron loss maps were approved, the off-momentum maps showed a priori unexpected losses in several arcs and the MD was stopped at this point for reasons of machine protection. The second part of the MD, where the effect of Q'' in terms of the mitigation of collective effects was meant to be studied, could hence not be performed and may be addressed in a future MD.},

Further testing on a machine where the phase of the coupling vector can be modified is needed. This is planned on the AD machine},

However modern science is currently facing problems with high complexity that cannot be solved by humans in the same timescale as by machines. Therefore there is a demand on automation of complex tasks. To identify the category of tasks which can be performed by machines in the domain of optics measurements and correction on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the central research subjects of this thesis. The application of machine learning methods and concepts of artificial intelligence can be found in various industry and scientific branches. In High Energy Physics these concepts are mostly used in offline analysis of experiments data and to perform regression tasks. In Accelerator Physics the machine learning approach has not found a wide application yet. Therefore potential tasks for machine learning solutions can be specified in this domain. The appropriate methods and their suitability for given requirements are to be investigated. The general question of this thesis is to identify the opportunities to apply machine learning methods to find and correct the errors in LHC optics and also to speed up beam measurements},

	abstract = {As the beam intensity increases, the beam can no longer be considered as a collection of non-interacting single particles: in addition to the “single-particle phenomena”, “collective effects” become significant. At low intensity a beam of charged particles moves around an accelerator under the Lorentz force produced by the “external” electromagnetic fields (from the guiding and focusing magnets, RF cavities, etc.). However, the charged particles also interact with themselves (leading to space charge effects) and with their environment, inducing charges and currents in the surrounding structures, which create electromagnetic fields called wake fields. In the ultra-relativistic limit, causality dictates that there can be no electromagnetic field in front of the beam, which explains the term “wake”. It is often useful to examine the frequency content of the wake field (a time domain quantity) by performing a Fourier transformation on it. This leads to the concept of impedance (a frequency domain quantity), which is a complex function of frequency. The charged particles can also interact with other charged particles present in the accelerator (leading to two-stream effects, and in particular to electron cloud effects in positron/hadron machines) and with the counter-rotating beam in a collider (leading to beam–beam effects). As the beam intensity increases, all these “perturbations” should be properly quantified and the motion of the charged particles will eventually still be governed by the Lorentz force but using the total electromagnetic fields, which are the sum of the external and perturbation fields. Note that in some cases a perturbative treatment is not sufficient and the problem has to be solved self consistently. These perturbations can lead to both incoherent (i.e. of a single particle) and coherent (i.e. of the centre of mass) effects, in the longitudinal and in one or both transverse directions, leading to beam quality degradation or even partial or total beam losses. Fortunately, stabilising mechanisms exist, such as Landau damping, electronic feedback systems and linear coupling between the transverse planes (as in the case of a transverse coherent instability, one plane is usually more critical than the other).},

These interactions can arise from the unavoidable presence of residual gas in the accelerator vacuum chamber, or from the impact of particles lost from the beam on aperture limits around the accelerator, as well as the final beam dump. The wanted collisions of the beams in a collider to produce potentially interesting High Energy Physics events also reduces the density of the circulating beam and can produce high fluxes of secondary particles.},

The trajectory of a particle in the field depends hence on the particle velocity and on the space distribution of the field. The simplest case is that of a uniform magnetic field with a single component and velocity v normal to it, in which case the particle trajectory is a circle. A uniform field has thus a pure bending effect on a charged particle, and the magnet that generates it is generally referred to as a dipole.},

flourishing in this domain, in view of providing new insights to beam dynamics in circular accelerators, in different laboratories worldwide. This is, for instance, the case for the CERN Large
Hadron Collider, where since a few years exploratory studies are being carried out. A broad
range of topics have been addressed, such as anomaly detection of beam position monitors, analysis of optimal correction tools for linear optics, optimisation of the collimation system, lifetime
and performance optimisation, and detection of hidden correlations in the huge data set of beam
dynamics observables collected during the LHC Run 2. Furthermore, very recently, machine
learning techniques are being scrutinised for the advanced analysis of numerical simulations data,
in view of improving our models of dynamic aperture evolution.},

This paper presents an algorithm developed to compute automatically local corrections. This algorithm has been successfully used in the LHC and in simulations of the HL-LHC to establish tolerances for the magnetic errors. The limitations of the current β∗ measurement technique (K-modulation) are studied, together with alternative techniques for β∗ control: computing the minimum β near the IP using the betatron phase measured with new instrumentation and locating the beam waist via luminosity scans. This push toward smaller beam sizes also requires large β-functions in the arcs that enhance local errors currently negligible. Experimental results of a way of correcting this new type of local errors using orbit bumps in sextupoles is also presented. These studies forecast a drastic change in the LHC commissioning strategy to be applied in the HL-LHC for needing luminosity measurements in intermediate stages.},

	abstract = {Halo diffusion measurements at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) were conducted with beams for physics at 6.5 TeV by means of collimator scans, carried out between 2016 and 2018. From the time evolution of the beam losses recorded during a collimator scan, in which collimator jaws are moved in steps toward the beam core cutting beam tails, one can extract information on the halo diffusion and its population as a function of the transverse amplitude. In this paper, results of the first scans performed at different beam intensities for both planes and both beams using the primary collimators of the betatron-cleaning system are presented. The scans were performed with squeezed optics and colliding beams after a few hours of regular physics production, during so-called end-of-fill measurements. Beam losses are measured with ionization chambers close to the collimators, which enable 1 and 100 Hz acquisitions, as well as diamond beam loss monitors, which enable turn-by-turn and bunch-by-bunch acquisitions. Parametric fits of a diffusion model are applied to the time profile of losses, for both total and individual bunch intensity. The analysis of the measurements performed in various conditions was used to estimate the diffusion coefficient as a function of the transverse amplitude and the population of LHC beam tails.},

	title = {Introduction to the {Polymorphic} {Tracking} {Code}},
	url = {http://cds.cern.ch/record/573082},
	abstract = {This is a description of the basic ideas behind the “Polymorphic Tracking Code” or PTC. PTC
is truly a “kick code” or symplectic integrator in the tradition of TRACYII, SixTrack, and TEAPOT.
However it separates correctly the mathematical atlas of charts and the magnets at a structural level
by implementing a “restricted fibre bundle.” The resulting structures allow backward propagation
and recirculation, something not possible in standard tracking codes.
Also PTC is polymorphic in handling real (single, double and even quadruple precision) and
Taylor series. Therefore it has all the tools associated to the TPSA packages: Lie methods, Normal
Forms, Cosy-Infinity capabilities, beam envelopesfor radiation, etc., as well as parameter dependence
on-the-fly. However PTC is an integrator, and as such, one must, generally, adhere to the Talman
“exactness” view of modelling. Incidentally, it supports exact sector and rectangular bends as well.
Of course, one can certainly bypass its integrator and the user is free to violate Talman’s principles
on his own; PTC provides the tools to dig one’s grave but not the encouragement.
The reader will find in Appendix B a PowerPoint presentation of FPP. The presentation is a bit
out of date but it gives a good idea of FPP which is essential to PTC. FPP is a stand-alone library and
can be used by anyone with a FORTRAN90 compiler.
This presentation is also, to be honest, a place where the authors intend to document very incompletely
nearly two years of work: the development of FPP and subsequently that of PTC.
Our ultimate intention is to morph PTC completely into MAD-X. The code MAD-X is an upgrade
of MAD-8 and not of the C++ CLASSIC based code MAD-9. The present document does not address
when and how this will be done. It is also our goal to link, if possible, PTC with CAD programs for
the design of complex follow-the-terrain beam lines. So far FPP and PTC have been used in the
design of beam separators (complex polymorphs) and recirculators. They have also been linked with
the code BMAD from Cornell. There is still a lot of work to be done if these tools are to be generally
usable by a wide range of people.
In addition, more complex structures will be needed to handle effects beyond single particle
dynamics in a way which respects the fundamental mathematical integrity of the structures of PTC.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05836},
	abstract = {Corrections of gradient errors in the interactions regions (IRs) of high energy colliders have traditionally been made by changing the strengths of quadrupoles that are common to both beams, such as the triplet quadrupoles. This article shows that magnetic errors in the IR quadrupoles that are no common to both beams, such as the matching quadrupoles, can have an important influence and, therefore, the correction should also include these quadrupoles. A correction based on twelve IR quadrupoles (common and no common) is presented and validated through MADX simulations. To estimate the strengths of this correction, the action and phase in the inter-triplet space, the space that separates the two triplets of the IR, are required. A novel method to estimate these quantities is also presented. The main sources of uncertainties in this novel method are identified and compared to the current method that uses two beam position monitor within the inter-triplet space. Finally, LHC experimental data is used to estimate the strengths of a twelve-quadrupole correction in the interaction region 1 of the LHC. The resulting correction is compared with a six-quadrupole correction estimated with another method called segment-by-segment (SBS).},

	abstract = {SixTrack is a single-particle tracking code for high-energy circular accelerators routinely used at CERN for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), its luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC), the Future Circular Collider (FCC) and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) simulations. The code is based on a 6D symplectic tracking engine, which is optimized for long-term tracking simulations and delivers fully reproducible results on several platforms. It also includes multiple scattering engines for beam–matter interaction studies, as well as facilities to run the integrated simulations with external particle matter interaction codes. These features differentiate SixTrack from general-purpose, optics-design software. The code recently underwent a major restructuring to merge the advanced features into a single branch, such as multiple ion species, interface with external codes and high-performance input/output. This restructuring also removed a large number of compilation flags, instead enabling/disabling the functionality with runtime options. In the process, the code was moved from Fortran 77 to Fortran 2018 standard, also allowing and achieving a better modularization. Physics models (beam–beam effects, Radio-Frequency (RF) multipoles, current carrying wires, solenoid and electron lenses) and methods (symplecticity check) have also been reviewed and refined to offer more accurate results. The SixDesk runtime environment allows the user to manage the large batches of simulations required for accurate predictions of the dynamic aperture. SixDesk supports several cluster environments available at CERN as well as submitting jobs to the LHC@Home volunteering computing project, which enables volunteers contributing with their hardware to CERN simulation. SixTrackLib is a new library aimed at providing a portable and flexible tracking engine for single- and multi-particle problems using the models and formalism of SixTrack. The library is able to run in CPUs as well as graphical processing units (GPUs). This contribution presents the status of the code, summarizes the main existing features and provides details about the main development lines SixTrack, SixDesk and SixTrackLib.},

	abstract = {The Large Hadron electron Collider, LHeC, is the means to move deep inelastic physics following HERA to the energy frontier of particle physics as it is being exploited by the HL-LHC. The paper presents a thorough update of the initial LHeC Conceptual Design Report (CDR) published in 2012. It comprises new results on the far reaching physics programme on parton structure, QCD dynamics, electroweak and top physics. It is shown how LHeC will open a new chapter of nuclear particle physics by extending the kinematic range in lepton-nucleus scattering by several orders of magnitude. Owing to an enhanced luminosity goal, the high centre of mass energy and the cleanliness of the neutral and charged current final states, the LHeC has a very remarkable Higgs programme and a promising potential to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. The design is for concurrent LHeC and HL-LHC operation which paves the way for transforming the LHC in its final phase of operation to a high precision Higgs and electroweak physics facility with also a much increased range to explore new physics up to 100 TeV mass, as is demonstrated in a separate chapter. Building on the CDR, the paper presents a detailed updated design of the energy recovery electron linac (ERL) including new lattice, magnet, SRF technology and interaction region designs. A lower energy, high current ERL facility, PERLE at Orsay, is described which uses the basic LHeC configuration parameters, a 3-turn racetrack, the source, and cryo-module designs, enabling it to serve as a development facility assisting the design and anticipated operation of the LHeC. The electron accelerator frequency is now chosen to be \$801.58\${\textbackslash},MHz and the first 5-cell Niobium cavity is presented which has reached a \$Q\_0\$ of \$3 {\textbackslash}cdot 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ exceeding the design goal. An updated detector design, including a forward hadron tagger, is presented as a base for the acceptance, resolution and calibration goals which arise from the Higgs and PDF physics programme. The detector is shown to require an installation time of two years which is commensurate with typical LHC shutdown durations. The paper comprises a brief report of the LHeC international advisory committee with recommendations on the next steps to be made in preparing the possible endorsement of the LHeC as part of the LHC project. While the paper is dedicated to the LHeC, it also presents novel results on the FCC-eh which is designed to utilise the same ERL technology, or a relocated LHeC depending on future developments of the energy frontier collider landscape},

Inevitable errors like imperfection of magnetic field and misalignment of magnets will introduce various destructive effects on the performance of the machine. The possibility of correcting the errors should be thoroughly examined before settling the design. In this paper, we have tried to estimate the errors as realistic as possible based on the results obtained from the simulation of the elements and the accuracy of the predicted equipment for fabrication and alignment. The influence of errors on the lattice is investigated.

We refer to this modified algorithm as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). It is shown that all additional computation required for the OMP algorithm may be performed recursively. 1 Introduction and Background  Given a collection of vectors D = fx i g in a Hilbert space H, let us define  V = Spanfxn g; and W = V  ?

This is simpler and (empirically) faster than convex approaches. Empirically, they both succeed in the same regime. Further analysis shows that, in the same noise regime as previously studied, secondorder necessary optimality conditions for this quadratically constrained quadratic program are also suﬃcient, despite nonconvexity.},

	title = {Novel beam-based correction and stabilisation methods for particle accelerators},
	url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/2677131},
	abstract = {Precise control of beam optics and beam stability is of critical importance for machine protection and performance of today's high-energy particle accelerators. For the next generation of accelerators, the tolerances are even tighter.  This thesis presents new methods and improved techniques to efficiently identify, measure and correct a range of errors in particle accelerators. Circular and linear accelerators have been studied in parallel.  The Circular Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collides mostly protons at energies of 6.5 TeV and European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) storage ring accelerates electrons to produce synchrotron light. The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) will provide electron-positron collisions at centre of mass energies up to 3 TeV. In CLIC, a non-colliding beam, referred to as drive beam, generates RF power to accelerate the main beam. LHC's optics measurement scheme was improved, also by studying ESRF. This resulted in significantly improved \${\textbackslash}beta\$-function  measurement, achieving twice the best-documented precision so far.  The optics correction algorithm was improved allowing \${\textbackslash}beta\$-beating in the LHC to systematically reach a level below 1.8\% rms.  An adiabatic simultaneous 3-dimensional beam excitation, which combines AC-dipoles  with RF-frequency modulation, significantly sped up beam optics measurements.  The analysis of beam frequency spectra from turn-by-turn data was also made   significantly faster, in the LHC by a factor \${\textbackslash}sim 300\$. These results contributed to LHC's excellent performance beyond its designed targets.  They also contributed towards its upgrade the High Luminosity LHC.  CLIC has stringent requirements on drive beam stability in terms of beam current, energy and phase. In the CLIC Test Facility 3 (CTF3), a novel algorithm to identify drifts and correlations was developed and applied in a study of drive beam stabilisation. The underlying causes of drifts were found and multiple beam-based feedbacks were developed and commissioned in CTF3, in this way achieving the stability goals. These improvements therefore played a key role in demonstrating the viability of CLIC in terms of drive beam stability.},

	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevSTAB.17.074001},
	abstract = {Beam lifetime in storage rings and colliders is affected by, among other effects, lattice nonlinearities. Their control are of great benefit to the dynamic aperture of an accelerator, whose enlargement leads in general to more efficient injection and longer lifetime. This article describes a procedure to evaluate and correct unwanted nonlinearities by using turn-by-turn beam position monitor data, which is an evolution of previous works on the resonance driving terms (RDTs). Effective sextupole magnetic errors and tilts at the ESRF electron storage ring are evaluated and corrected (when possible) by using this technique. For the first time, also octupolar RDTs could be measured and used to define an octupolar model for the main quadrupoles. Most of the deviations from the model observed in the sextupolar RDTs of the ESRF storage ring turned out to be generated by focusing errors rather than by sextupole errors. These results could be achieved thanks to new analytical formulas describing the harmonic content of the nonlinear betatron motion to the second order. For the first time, RDTs have been also used for beam-based calibration of individual sextupole magnets. They also proved to be a powerful tool in predicting faulty magnets and in validating magnetic models. This technique provides also a figure of merit for a self-assessment of the reliability of the data analysis.},

The motivation arises in the possibility of finding a method to reliably extrapolate the results of numerical simulations well beyond what is currently possible in terms of CPU time. In earlier work, a proposal for a model based on Nekhoroshev theorem and Kolmogorov--Arnold--Moser theory was made. This model has been studied in detail and proved successful in describing the evolution of the dynamic aperture in numerical simulations, however, a number of shortcomings had been identified and new models are proposed in this paper, which solve the observed issues. The new models have been benchmarked against numerical simulations for a simple system, the 4D H{\textbackslash}'enon map, as well as a realistic, non-linear representation of the beam dynamics in the LHC at 6.5 TeV providing in both cases excellent results.},

	abstract = {We present a novel statistical moments-based method for optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) monitoring in polarization-multiplexed (pol-mux) coherent optical systems. This technique only requires the knowledge of the envelope of the equalized signal before phase correction, which can be achieved by using any two arbitrary statistical moments, and it is suitable for both constant and non-constant modulus modulation formats. The proposed estimation method is experimentally demonstrated for 10-Gbaud pol-mux coherent systems using QPSK and 16-QAM. Additionally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate 20-Gbaud systems using 16-QAM and 64-QAM. The results show that the OSNR can be estimated accurately over a wide range of values for QPSK, 16-QAM or 64-QAM systems up to 1920-km long and with up to 50-ps all-order polarization mode dispersion. By setting a proper reference value for calibration, the proposed algorithm also shows good tolerance when the received signal is not well compensated.},

Various models have been proposed which improve over the GN model accuracy. One of them is the EGN model, which completely removes the Gaussianity approximation from all non-linear interference (NLI) components. The EGN model is, however, substantially more complex than the GN model. Recently, we proposed a simple closed-form formula which permits to approximate the EGN model, starting from the GN. It was however limited to all-identical, equispaced channels, and did not correct single-channel NLI (also called SCI). In this follow-up contribution, we propose an improved version which both allows to address non-identical channels and corrects the SCI contribution as well. Extensive simulative testing shows the new formula to be asymptotically very accurate, for sufficiently large number of spans. This is a preliminary document which will be followed by a journal submission.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1204},
	abstract = {We model the build-up of inter-channel nonlinear interference noise (NLIN) in wavelength division multiplexed systems by considering the pulse collision dynamics in the time domain. The fundamental interactions can be classified as two-pulse, three-pulse, or four-pulse collisions and they can be either complete, or incomplete. Each type of collision is shown to have its unique signature and the overall nature of NLIN is determined by the relative importance of the various classes of pulse collisions in a given WDM system. The pulse-collision picture provides qualitative and quantitative insight into the character of NLIN, offering a simple and intuitive explanation to all of the reported and previously unexplained phenomena. In particular, we show that the most important contributions to NLIN follow from two-pulse and four-pulse collisions. While the contribution of two-pulse collisions is in the form of phase-noise and polarization-state-rotation with strong dependence on modulation format, four-pulse collisions generate complex circular noise whose variance is independent of modulation format. In addition, two-pulse collisions are strongest when the collision is complete, whereas four-pulse collisions are strongest when the collision is incomplete. We show that two-pulse collisions dominate the formation of NLIN in short links with lumped amplification, or in links with distributed amplification extending over arbitrary length. In long links using lumped amplification the relative significance of four-pulse collisions increases, emphasizing the circularity of the NLIN while reducing its dependence on modulation format.},

	url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/2692915},
	abstract = {This thesis investigates with a structured and precise analysis the behaviour of programs execution during trace-based just-in-time (JIT) compilation. The work was carried out in the context of the tracing just-in-time compiler LuaJIT embedded in the Next Generation of the Methodical Accelerator Design software (MAD-NG). MAD software series provides a scripting language, which is a de facto standard to describe particle accelerators, simulate beam dynamics, and optimise beam optics at CERN. It has to process a massive quantity of data and operations with user-deﬁned expressions during simulation, hence it needs to be very eﬃcient. A technology that fulﬁls these demands is LuaJIT, a trace-based just-in-time compiler for the Lua programming language. Trace-based just in time compilation is a technique used for dynamic interpreted languages. It consists of recording a linear path of frequently executed operations, so-called trace, compiling it to native machine code and executing it. To accomplish this work we proposed some extensions for the existing analysis tools provided by LuaJIT and we realised some post-processing analysis to inspect the traces generated by the JIT during the execution of a program. It is necessary to understand all the mechanisms performed by a tracing JIT compiler under the hood in order to better proﬁt from trace-based just-in-time compilation. The consciousness of the internal mechanisms behind a tracing JIT compiler leads to take high-level software decision in JIT-friendly style.},

	abstract = {For a single hadron bunch in a circular accelerator at zero chromaticity, without multi-turn wakes and without electron clouds and other beams, only one transverse collective instability is possible, the mode-coupling instability, or TMCI. For sufficiently strong space charge (SC), the instability threshold of the wake-driven coherent tune shift normally increases linearly with the SC tune shift, as independently concluded by several authors using different methods. This stability condition has, however, a very strange feature: at strong SC, it is totally insensitive to the number of particles. Thus, were it correct, such a beam with sufficiently strong SC, being stable at some intensity, would remain stable at higher intensity, regardless of how much higher! This paper suggests a resolution of this conundrum: while SC suppresses TMCI, it introduces head-to-tail convective amplifications, which could make the beam even less stable than without SC, even if all the coherent tunes are real, i.e. all the modes are stable in the conventional \{{\textbackslash}it absolute\} meaning of the word. This is done using an effective new method of analysis of the beam's transverse spectrum for arbitrary space charge and wake fields. Two new types of beam instabilities are introduced: the \{{\textbackslash}it saturating convective instability\}, SCI, and the \{{\textbackslash}it absolute-convective instability\}, ACI.},

	abstract = {Modern colliders bring into collision a large number of bunches to achieve a high luminosity. The long-range beam-beam effects arising from parasitic encounters at such colliders are mitigated by introducing a crossing angle. Under these conditions, crab cavities (CC) can be used to restore effective head-on collisions and thereby to increase the geometric luminosity. Such crab cavities have been proposed for both linear and circular colliders. The crab cavities are rf cavities operated in a transverse dipole mode, which imparts on the beam particles a transverse kick that varies with the longitudinal position along the bunch. The use of crab cavities in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may not only raise the luminosity, but it could also complicate the beam dynamics, e.g., crab cavities might not only cancel synchrobetatron resonances excited by the crossing angle but they could also excite new ones, they could reduce the dynamic aperture for off-momentum particles, they could influence the aperture and orbit, also degrade the collimation cleaning efficiency, and so on. In this paper, we explore the principal feasibility of LHC crab cavities from a beam dynamics point of view. The implications of the crab cavities for the LHC optics, analytical and numerical luminosity studies, dynamic aperture, aperture and beta beating, emittance growth, beam-beam tune shift, long-range collisions, and synchrobetatron resonances, crab dispersion, and collimation efficiency will be discussed.},

A decrease in the expected luminosity with respect to the case without crossing angle has been recently observed in simulations for the CLIC baseline configuration. This effect is explained from the aberrations induced due to a z-dependent off-center horizontal orbit in the final focus sextupoles produced by the crab cavity. Three options to recover from this loss are explored. The effect of the longitudinal E−z correlation of the incoming beam from the linac is taken into account and its effect on the expected luminosity is evaluated.},

	abstract = {The physics programme and the design are described of a new collider for particle and nuclear physics, the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC), in which a newly built electron beam of 60 GeV, to possibly 140 GeV, energy collides with the intense hadron beams of the LHC. Compared to the first ep collider, HERA, the kinematic range covered is extended by a factor of twenty in the negative four-momentum squared, Q2, and in the inverse Bjorken x, while with the design luminosity of 1033 cm-2 s-1 the LHeC is projected to exceed the integrated HERA luminosity by two orders of magnitude. The physics programme is devoted to an exploration of the energy frontier, complementing the LHC and its discovery potential for physics beyond the Standard Model with high precision deep inelastic scattering measurements. These are designed to investigate a variety of fundamental questions in strong and electroweak interactions. The LHeC thus continues the path of deep inelastic scattering (DIS) into unknown areas of physics and kinematics. The physics programme also includes electron-deuteron and electron-ion scattering in a (Q21/x) range extended by four orders of magnitude as compared to previous lepton-nucleus DIS experiments for novel investigations of neutron's and nuclear structure, the initial conditions of Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and further quantum chromodynamic phenomena. The LHeC may be realised either as a ring-ring or as a linac-ring collider. Optics and beam dynamics studies are presented for both versions, along with technical design considerations on the interaction region, magnets including new dipole prototypes, cryogenics, RF, and further components. A design study is also presented of a detector suitable to perform high precision DIS measurements in a wide range of acceptance using state-of-the art detector technology, which is modular and of limited size enabling its fast installation. The detector includes tagging devices for electron, photon, proton and neutron detection near to the beam pipe. Civil engineering and installation studies are presented for the accelerator and the detector. The LHeC can be built within a decade and thus be operated while the LHC runs in its high-luminosity phase. It so represents a major opportunity for progress in particle physics exploiting the investment made in the LHC.},

The ATF2 nominal and ultralow β∗ lattices are designed to vertically focus the beam at the focal point, or usually referred to as interaction point (IP), down to 37 and 23 nm, respectively. The vertical chromaticities of the nominal and ultralow β∗ lattices are comparable to those of ILC and CLIC, respectively. When the measured multipole components of the ATF2 magnets are considered in the simulations, the evaluated spot sizes at the IP are well above the design values. In this paper we describe the analysis of the high order aberrations that allows identifying the sources of the observed beam size growth. In order to recover the design spot sizes three solutions are considered, namely final doublet replacement, octupole insertion, and optics modification. Concerning the future linear collider projects, the consequences of magnetic field errors of the focusing quadrupole magnet of the final doublet are also addressed.},

The beam optics of the ATF2 beam line is designed based on a local chromaticity correction scheme similar to the ILC final focus system. Beam measurements in 2012 revealed skew sextupole field errors that were much larger than expected from magnetic field measurements. The skew sextupole field error was a critical limitation of the beam size at the ATF2 virtual interaction point (IP). Therefore, four skew sextupole magnets were installed to correct the field error in August 2012. By using the four skew sextupole magnets, the predicted tolerances of the skew sextupole field errors of the ATF2 magnets were increased. Furthermore, analyzing field maps of the sextupole magnets identified the source of the skew sextupole field error. After the field error source was removed, the IP vertical beam size could more easily be focused to less than 65 nm.},

At KEKB, CCs have exhibited abrupt changes of phase and voltage during a time period of the order of a few LHC turns and considering the significant stored energy in the HL-LHC beam, CC failures represent a serious threat in regard to LHC machine protection. In this paper, we discuss the effect of CC voltage or phase changes on a time interval similar to, or longer than, the one needed to dump the beam. The simulations assume a quasistationary-state distribution to assess the particles losses for the HL-LHC. These distributions produce beam losses below the safe operation threshold for Gaussian tails, while, for non-Gaussian tails are on the same order of the limit. Additionally, some mitigation strategies are studied for reducing the damage caused by the CC failures.},

With exceptionally small and flat beams, the luminosity can be significantly degraded due to the combination of the experimental solenoid field and a large crossing angle. The two main effects reducing the luminosity are y−x′-coupling and an increase of vertical dispersion. Additionally, incoherent synchrotron radiation (ISR) from the orbit deflection created by the solenoid field increases the beam emittance and results in unrecoverable luminosity degradation. A novel approach to evaluate the ISR effect from a realistic solenoid field without knowledge of the full compensation of the geometric aberrations is presented. This approach is confirmed by a detailed study of the correction techniques to compensate the beam optics distortions. The unrecoverable luminosity loss due to ISR for CLIC at 3 TeV has been evaluated, and found to be around 4\% to 5\% for the solenoid design under study.},

The linear effects are studied by replacing the hard-edge quadrupolar field by the more realistic gradient fall-off. To address the nonlinear effects, the fringe fields are represented as high order kicks added to both sides of the hard-edge magnets. It will be shown that the linear fringe fields effects can be easily cured by tuning the quadrupole strengths. On the other hand, mitigation of the nonlinear fringe fields effects is more difficult and requires use of octupole magnets or, alternatively, increasing the value of interaction point horizontal beta function β∗x.},

In this paper, an extended comparison of the Compact Linear Collider local FFS and an improved nonlocal FFS is presented at 3 TeV and 500 GeV.

	abstract = {Ground motion is a severe problem for many particle accelerators, since it excites beam oscillations, which decrease the beam quality and create beam-beam offset (at colliders). Orbit feedback systems can only compensate ground motion effects at frequencies significantly smaller than the beam repetition rate. In linear colliders, where the repetition rate is low, additional counter measures have to be put in place. For this reason, a ground motion mitigation method based on feed-forward control is presented in this paper. It has several advantages compared to other techniques (stabilization systems and intratrain feedback systems) such as cost reduction and potential performance improvement. An analytical model is presented that allows the derivation of hardware specification and performance estimates for a specific accelerator and ground motion model. At the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF2), ground motion sensors have been installed to verify the feasibility of important parts of the mitigation strategy. In experimental studies, it has been shown that beam excitations due to ground motion can be predicted from ground motion measurements on a pulse-to-pulse basis. Correlations of up to 80\% between the estimated and measured orbit jitter have been observed. Additionally, an orbit jitter source was identified and has been removed, which halved the orbit jitter power at ATF2 and shows that the feed-forward scheme is also very useful for the detection of installation issues. We believe that the presented mitigation method has the potential to reduce costs and improve the performance of linear colliders and potentially other linear accelerators.},

	abstract = {The large hadron electron collider (LHeC) is a proposed upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) within the high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) project, to provide electron-nucleon collisions and explore a new regime of energy and luminosity for deep inelastic scattering. The design of an interaction region for any collider is always a challenging task given that the beams are brought into crossing with the smallest beam sizes in a region where there are tight detector constraints. In this case integrating the LHeC into the existing HL-LHC lattice, to allow simultaneous proton-proton and electron-proton collisions, increases the difficulty of the task. A nominal design was presented in the the LHeC conceptual design report in 2012 featuring an optical configuration that focuses one of the proton beams of the LHC to β∗=10 cm in the LHeC interaction point to reach the desired luminosity of L=1033 cm−2 s−1. This value is achieved with the aid of a new inner triplet of quadrupoles at a distance L∗=10 m from the interaction point. However the chromatic beta beating was found intolerable regarding machine protection issues. An advanced chromatic correction scheme was required. This paper explores the feasibility of the extension of a novel optical technique called the achromatic telescopic squeezing scheme and the flexibility of the interaction region design, in order to find the optimal solution that would produce the highest luminosity while controlling the chromaticity, minimizing the synchrotron radiation power and maintaining the dynamic aperture required for stability.},

	abstract = {The Oide effect considers the synchrotron radiation in the final focusing quadrupole, and it sets a lower limit on the vertical beam size at the interaction point, particularly relevant for high-energy linear colliders. The theory of the Oide effect was derived considering only the second moment of the radiation in the focusing plane of the magnet. This article addresses the theoretical calculation of the radiation effect on the beam size considering the first and second moments of the radiation and both focusing and defocusing planes of the quadrupole. The effect for a Gaussian beam is referred to as 2D-Oide; however, an alternative beam size figure is given that could represent better the effect on the minimum achievable β∗y. The CLIC 3 TeV final quadrupole (QD0) and beam parameters are used to compare the theoretical results from the Oide effect and the 2D-Oide effect with particle tracking in placet. The 2D-Oide effect is demonstrated to be important, as it increases by 17\% the contribution to the beam size. Further insight into the aberrations induced by the synchrotron radiation opens the possibility to partially correct the 2D-Oide effect with octupole magnets. A beam size reduction of 4\% is achieved in the simplest configuration, using a single octupole.},

In this paper, we give the first outlook of the behavior of the LHC magnets operating at this field level, corresponding to 8-T peak field in the main dipoles. The main magnetic features are reconstructed through the beam measurements, mainly the tune (quadrupolar components) and the chromaticity (sextupolar components). The decay and snapback at injection and the start of the ramp are expected to increase by 50\% due to the higher operational current. The behavior at high field will be affected by the saturation components, which were barely visible in one magnet family in the 4-TeV runs and totally invisible in the rest. Although the initial plan aims at a rather conservative value of β*, during the squeeze, the triplet and matching section quadrupole will become important. Beam measurements will provide interesting information about the magnetic behavior of these quadrupoles; in particular, through beta beating, we will estimate the absolute precision of the knowledge of the quadrupole strength. The statistics of the beam measurements will be rather limited in the first stages of commissioning, but should already reveal the main features of the 6.5-TeV operation.},

KEK Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2), a scaled down implementation of the linear collider beam delivery system, serves for demonstrating the feasibility of the final focus system (FFS). An unprecedented low vertical beam size at the IP of about 40 nm has been already measured in ATF2 using the optics with a nominal β∗y. In our study we decrease the β∗y value in order to investigate the performance of more chromatic optics and to study the limits of beam focusing at the IP. Stronger beam focusing amplifies the aberrations from the final focus imperfections which cause an increase of the beam size at the IP. Simulations show that the multipolar errors and final doublet fringe fields spoil the IP beam sizes for ultralow β∗y optics but can be mitigated either by increasing the value of the horizontal β∗ or installing a pair of octupole magnets. We report on our first experimental steps towards the ultralow β∗y in ATF2. New methods for the beam diagnostics at the IP were developed in order to precisely set the desired optics. β∗y value was half the nominal value. The beam tuning was performed and the measured beam size is compared with the simulation results.},

In previous studies, 90\% of the machines reached 90\% of the nominal luminosity at the expense of 18 000 luminosity measurements, when considering beam position monitor errors and transverse misalignments of magnets for a single beam case. In the present study, additional static imperfections such as roll misalignments and strength errors are included. Moreover both e− and e+ beamlines are properly simulated.

	abstract = {The high luminosity requirement for a future linear collider sets a demanding limit on the beam quality at the Interaction Point (IP). One potential source of luminosity loss is the motion of the ground itself. The resulting misalignments of the quadrupole magnets cause distortions to the beam orbit and hence an increase in the beam emittance. This paper describes a technique for compensating this orbit distortion by using seismometers to monitor the misalignment of the quadrupole magnets in real-time. The first demonstration of the technique was achieved at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at KEK in Japan. The feed-forward system consisted of a seismometer-based quadrupole motion monitoring system, an FPGA-based feed-forward processor and a stripline kicker plus associated electronics. Through the application of a kick calculated from the position of a single quadruple, the system was able to remove about 80\% of the component of the beam jitter that was correlated to the motion of the quadrupole. As a significant fraction of the orbit jitter in the ATF final focus is due to sources other than quadrupole misalignment, this amounted to an approximately 15\% reduction in the absolute beam jitter.},

Furthermore, ADeCTA is investigated for the first time with driven oscillations. We show analytically that skew quadrupoles and normal octupoles do not generate ADeCTA for forced oscillations in the same way as for free oscillations. This adds an additional constraint to measure it since the forced oscillations, generated by an ac dipole, are the preferred option for optics measurements in the LHC.

	abstract = {We review the physics opportunities of the Future Circular Collider, covering its e+e-, pp, ep and heavy ion programmes. We describe the measurement capabilities of each FCC component, addressing the study of electroweak, Higgs and strong interactions, the top quark and flavour, as well as phenomena beyond the Standard Model. We highlight the synergy and complementarity of the different colliders, which will contribute to a uniquely coherent and ambitious research programme, providing an unmatchable combination of precision and sensitivity to new physics.},

	abstract = {In response to the 2013 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics, the Future Circular Collider (FCC) study was launched, as an international collaboration hosted by CERN. This study covers a highest-luminosity high-energy lepton collider (FCC-ee) and an energy-frontier hadron collider (FCC-hh), which could, successively, be installed in the same 100 km tunnel. The scientific capabilities of the integrated FCC programme would serve the worldwide community throughout the 21st century. The FCC study also investigates an LHC energy upgrade, using FCC-hh technology. This document constitutes the second volume of the FCC Conceptual Design Report, devoted to the electron-positron collider FCC-ee. After summarizing the physics discovery opportunities, it presents the accelerator design, performance reach, a staged operation scenario, the underlying technologies, civil engineering, technical infrastructure, and an implementation plan. FCC-ee can be built with today’s technology. Most of the FCC-ee infrastructure could be reused for FCC-hh. Combining concepts from past and present lepton colliders and adding a few novel elements, the FCC-ee design promises outstandingly high luminosity. This will make the FCC-ee a unique precision instrument to study the heaviest known particles (Z, W and H bosons and the top quark), offering great direct and indirect sensitivity to new physics.},

It aims to achieve a record high luminosity of 8×1035 cm−2 s−1, for which accurate control of β∗y is needed. The advanced final focus system is also relevant for studies related to future linear colliders, which similarly need to achieve very small beam sizes. To work for SuperKEKB, the K modulation technique is generalized to allow known quadrupole fields between the modulated magnets and the interaction point. Initial measurements taken in HER agree with simulations, and show that K modulation is suitable for measuring the minimum of the β function at the interaction point within 1\%, however it is too uncertain to be used for measuring the displacement of the beam waist away from the interaction point. In addition, tune shift equations for a modulated quadrupole are derived without assuming a thin lens perturbation, giving a simple method to calculate the tune shift to second order in the quadrupole strength modulation.},

To have reliable performance of a collider, nominal luminosity must be reached quickly under a set of various imperfections. Measuring luminosity at high energies is a nontrivial task, and, to get a precise measurement, many collisions must be sampled. Therefore, it is desirable to use other beam-beam signals for faster tuning. This paper studies the use of beamstrahlung and incoherent pairs in an extensive simulation study including static imperfections. Tuning results of the nominal lattice are compared to an updated lattice with a smaller vertical beam size at the interaction point. Finally, recovery time after machine downtime and misalignment of components due to ground motion is also studied.},

The observed vertical beam size is about 20 nm above the numerical predictions in the presence of static and dynamic imperfections.

Higher beam energies can be realized by pushing the installed main dipoles to their limits or by replacing different fractions of installed magnets. Moreover, a revised lattice design for a full energy upgrade, also known as the high-energy LHC (HE-LHC), is presented. The studies reported focus on the linear optics design and on the lattice layout. In particular, an optics with 60° transverse phase advance in the regular arc cells, meant to alleviate the strength requirements for the main quadrupoles, has been designed in view of possible beam tests during the next LHC run 3. The methods developed in this article, for matching the ring geometry to a reference tunnel, for improving the beam aperture, and for minimizing the required field strengths for new high-energy LHC-like machines, will also be applicable to other future circular collider projects.},

	abstract = {Optics measurements at the LHC are mainly based on turn-by-turn signal from hundreds of beam position monitors (BPMs). Faulty BPMs produce erroneous signal causing unreliable computation of optics functions. Therefore, detection of faulty BPMs prior to optics computation is crucial for adequate optics analysis. Most of the faults can be removed by applying traditional cleaning techniques. However, optics functions reconstructed from the cleaned turn-by-turn data systematically exhibit a few nonphysical values which indicate the presence of remaining faulty BPMs. A novel method based on the Isolation Forest algorithm has been developed and applied in LHC operation, allowing to significantly reduce the number of undetected faulty BPMs, thus improving the optics measurements. This report summarizes the operational results and discusses the evaluation of the developed method on simulations, including extensive studies and optimization of the preexisting cleaning technique and verification of a new method in terms of coupling measurement. The advantages of the chosen algorithm compared to some other unsupervised learning techniques are also discussed.},

	url = {http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/261302},
	abstract = {The CHEASE code, which has been developed at the Swiss Plasma Center, generates an accurate reconstruction of toroidal magnetohydrodynamics equilibria by numerically solving the Grad-Shafranov equation. Having demonstrated its ability to achieve good convergence while remaining fast and very flexible, this code is now extensively used at different research facilities. From two input profiles, usually the pressure and the current density as well as specified boundary conditions, the code provides a complete equilibrium description which is essential for the study of tokamak plasmas. This project focuses on computing axisymmetric equilibria within ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by imposing a specific shape for the safety factor \$q\$. The Grad-Shafranov equation requires two free functions to be specified: one for the current density and one for the pressure (p=nT). Until now, the options in CHEASE allowed to give the pressure profile or its derivative on one hand and either \$TT'\$, \$I{\textasciicircum}*\$, \$I\_\{{\textbackslash}parallel\}\$, or \$J\_\{{\textbackslash}parallel\}\$ on the other hand. The safety factor profile was therefore a result of the computation of the equilibrium. However, this profile and its radial derivative are essential for stability and transport issues into the tokamak. The goal of the present project is thus to modify the code so as to be able to provide a safety factor profile as a CHEASE input. However, equilibria generated with the safety factor profile as input can easily lead to surface currents if strong variation of the derivative \${\textbackslash}frac\{dq\}\{d{\textbackslash}rho\}\$ appears in the solution. It is therefore necessary to develop a method to avoid these problems, especially at the edge of the plasma. A further aim of this work is hence to demonstrate that there is no continuity problem within solutions computed with a q-profile as input. There are two ways of achieving this: one is to impose the current profile within one iteration to obtain the desired safety factor profile and the other is to impose the \$TT'\$ profile in the same way. The two solutions are explored in this project with the purpose to determine which one is most appropriate. Finally, the extended version of CHEASE developed in this master project is used to study the influence of safety factor profiles on the stability of tearing modes by solving the energy principle equation within the cylindrical approximation which depends directly on \$q\$, \$q'\$ and \$q''\$},

From simulations of the current design of these dipoles, a systematic sextupole component of up to factor 10 larger than in the LHC dipoles could be present in these magnets. A similar systematic mispowering of the corrector circuits as is assumed in the LHC may thus have a signiﬁcantly larger impact on the dynamic aperture and in turn potentially also on the operational performance. During this MD, the dynamic aperture in the presence of large sextupole ﬁelds in the LHC at injection energy was measured. By deliberately mispowering the sextupole spool pieces attached to each dipole, a large systematic b3 component is generated and the subsequent change in chromaticity is corrected by the chromaticity sextupoles. Using both the aperture kicker and the AC-dipole as exciters, free and forced dynamic aperture as well as amplitude detuning were measured. Additional linear optics measurements provide insight into the contributions to coupling from the sextupole spool pieces.},

Chromatic parameters need measurements to be repeated at different beam energies, which is time-consuming. We present an optics measurement method based on adiabatic simultaneous 3-dimensional beam excitation, where no repetition at different energies is needed. In the LHC, the method has been successfully demonstrated utilising AC-dipoles combined with RF frequency modulation. It allows measuring the linear optics parameters and chromatic properties at the same time without resolution deterioration. We also present a new accurate harmonic analysis algorithm that exploits the noise cleaning based on singular value decomposition to compress the input data. In the LHC, this sped up harmonic analysis by a factor up to 300. These methods are becoming a \&quot;push the button\&quot; operational tool to measure the optics.},

	abstract = {Several transverse noise sources, such as power supply ripples, can potentially act as an important limiting mechanism for the luminosity production of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its future High-Luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). In the presence of non-linearities, depending on the spectral components of the power supply noise and the nature of the source, such a mechanism can increase the diffusion of the particles in the distribution through the excitation of sideband resonances in the vicinity of the ones driven by the lattice non-linearities. For the HL-LHC, due to the reduction of the beam size in the Interaction Points (IP) of the high luminosity experiments (IP1 and 5), increased sensitivity to noise effects is anticipated for the quadrupoles of the inner triplets. The modulation that may arise from the power supply ripples will be combined with the tune modulation that intrinsically emerges from the coupling of the transverse and longitudinal plane for off-momentum particles through chromaticity. To this end, the aim of this paper is to study the impact of tune modulation effects on the transverse beam motion resulting from the interplay between quadrupolar power supply ripples and synchro-betatron coupling. A power supply noise threshold for acceptable performance is estimated with single-particle tracking simulations by investigating the impact of different modulation frequencies and amplitudes on the Dynamic Aperture. The excitation of sideband resonances due to the modulation is demonstrated with frequency maps and the higher sensitivity to specific modulation frequencies is explained. Finally, a power supply noise spectrum consisting of several tones is considered in the simulations to determine whether the presence of power supply ripples in the quadrupoles of the inner triplet will limit the luminosity production in the HL-LHC era.},

A novel time series classification approach is applied to decrease beam time loss in the High Intensity Proton Accelerator complex by forecasting interlock events. The forecasting is performed through binary classification of windows of multivariate time series. The time series are transformed into Recurrence Plots which are then classified by a Convolutional Neural Network, which not only captures the inner structure of the time series but also utilizes the advances of image classification techniques. Our best performing interlock-to-stable classifier reaches an Area under the ROC Curve value of \$0.71 {\textbackslash}pm 0.01\$ compared to \$0.65 {\textbackslash}pm 0.01\$ of a Random Forest model, and it can potentially reduce the beam time loss by \$0.5 {\textbackslash}pm 0.2\$ seconds per interlock.},

	title = {Proceedings of the 2017 course on vacuum for particle accelerators. {Glumslov}, {Sweden}, 6–16 {June} 2017},
	abstract = {The school held in Glumslov is the third CERN Accelerator School (CAS) dedicated to vacuum, after those in Platja de Aro (ES, 2006) and Snekersten (DK, 1999); its main aim was to provide new generation of ex-perts with a detailed update on ‘Vacuum for Particle Accelerators’ with focus on materials and methods. Even though the content of the three schools is comparable, the last had a completely new format. It was longer, ten days instead of a week, and integrated practical works on five essential subjects for vacuum technology: Monte-Carlo simulation, impedance calculation, vacuum mechanics, leak detection, and residual gas analysis. The students were divided in five groups; each group participated in all practical training; and a final assessment was presented on the last days of the event by each group. The maximum number of participants was limited to 74 students by the available infrastructure; unfortunately, several requests of enrolment could not be accepted. Six grants were kindly offered by industrial sponsors and, among them, four for students of CERN non-Members States. Thirty-six lecturers and practical-work assistants conveyed their enthusiasm and state-of-the-art experience in vacuum technology and its impact on acceleration operation. The quality of the teaching and practical work is the result of the wise advice that the International Programme Committee had been given during the year-long preparation. The hands-on training needed the transport of several vacuum set-ups, com- puters, and instrumentation from Geneva to Glumslöv; a fully charged lorry was necessary. However, a small detail was forgotten: the hotel was not equipped with a forklift. It was only thanks to the remarkable local organizing committee, in particular Carolina Ingvander and Karolin Lundberg, and their persuasive action that we could unload the lorry with the help of a local farmer armed with a tractor normally used for hay-ball transport. Among the visits in the local area, the most remarkable was the one at MAX IV, a brand-new synchrotron radiation facility that adopted innovative solutions for the vacuum system of the 3-GeV storage ring. Eshraq Al Dmour, Marek Grabski and Pedro Fernandes Tavares guided the students along the impressive accelerator, one of the most ambitious European scientific infrastructures. The organisation of the school was flawless thanks to the experienced support of Roger Bailey, Werner Herr and Barbara Strasser, the missed “last CAS dinosaur” as she referred to herself. We welcomed the presence of Delphine Rivoiron for her first of a long series CAS. The Baltic See and its rapidly changing colours, the gentle hills of the Skåne County, and professionalism of many people, including the farmer, contributed to the success of this school. Finally, at the end, everybody agreed that we could not wait again 11 years to share our passion for vacuum technology at CAS},

The hierarchy breakage seen in a similar activity in 2015 when deploying 1 σ-retractions between TCSG and TCP collimators was conﬁrmed, and a viable solution demonstrated with beam. In addition, measurements of tune shifts induced by changes in collimator gaps were performed when moving the IR7 TCSG collimators all together, or when moving only those with the largest contribution to impedance. The MD activity included a re-alignment of all the IR7 collimators to the beam, prior to the investigations on the hierarchy breakage, and an instability threshold measurement, at the end. The MD activity is important for understanding the limitations from impedance; these limitations have direct impact on the choice of the machine conﬁguration kept during operation (e.g. for deploying TCP-TCSG retractions in IR7 smaller than the present ones), or for optimising the design of future devices (e.g. as presently foreseen by the HL-LHC project, since outcomes are important ingredients for ﬁnalizing the baseline conﬁguration of the upgraded collimation system).},

The vector and scalar potentials are obtained by summing the contributions of each monopole. The second step of the method improves the evaluation speed of the potentials and their derivatives by orders of magnitude. This comprises covering the region of interest by overlapping spheres, then calculating the spherical harmonic expansion of the potentials on each sphere. During tracking, field values are evaluated by calculating the solid harmonics and their derivatives inside a sphere containing the particle. Software has been developed to test and demonstrate the method on a small particle accelerator. To our knowledge, there is no other method of this kind, allowing long time symplectic integration in general static fields, without simplification.},

This note discussed the beam dynamics challenges, e.g. tolerances, stability, emittances, bunch structure, charge and size, that need to be faced in parallel with the gradient challenge},

	abstract = {The main aspects linked to Landau damping of head-tail instabilities at top energy in the HL-LHC are discussed, in particular the interplay between the arc octupoles and long-range, offset or head-on beam-beam interactions as well as lattice imperfections. When possible, the models are compared with the operational experience of Runs 1 and 2 of the LHC. Based on these considerations, various operational scenarios are discussed identifying their strengths and limitations.},

	abstract = {Beam Position Monitor measurement data are the primary source of optics properties computation for particle accelerators. These measurements and the subsequent results are suspected to be substantially inﬂuenced by both the BPM types used for the measurements and the value of the β-function at measuring BPMs. This study aims to verify those dependencies and gain insight on which conditions provide the best possible sets of measurements, for further applications to measurement and correction algorithms. To test the aforementioned hypothesis, some reasonable assumptions are made on BPM measurements and several calculations are derived from distribution properties underlying to these measurements. These were then applied to BPM data from the LHC Run II. The results proved the above hypothesis, showing a strong dependence of the measurements’ accuracy on BPM types and their β-functions. These results give insight on how to improve the accuracy of key measurements and open up potential applications in optimizing some of the methods used for optics reconstructions for the LHC.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics can impact circular machines’ performance and stability. A measurement of the machine nonlinearities can be obtained by characterizing the amplitude detuning: the dependency of the tune as a function of the amplitude of particle oscillations. It has been shown that the direct amplitude detuning coming from octupoles changes by a factor 2 depending on the nature of the betatron oscillations (free or forced oscillations). This study aims to investigate the hypothesis of the sextupolar amplitude detuning exhibiting similar behavior to that of octupolar amplitude detuning. To test this hypothesis, numerical simulations for the LHC were performed with MAD-X, both for an AC dipole driving the beam and for free oscillations. Analysis of the tracking data conﬁrmed the expected behavior.},

	abstract = {The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 1034 cm−2 s−1 (1027 cm−2 s−1). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4π solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values ({\textbar}η{\textbar} ⩽ 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.},

	abstract = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16 × 16 × 26 m3 with a total weight of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, with the exception of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.},

	url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/2229595},
	abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the biggest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world, designed to collide two proton beams with particle momentum of 7 TeV/c each. The stored energy of 362MJ in each beam is sufficient to melt 500 kg of copper or to evaporate about 300 liter of water. An accidental release of even a small fraction of the beam energy can cause severe damage to accelerator equipment. Reliable machine protection systems are necessary to safely operate the accelerator complex. To design a machine protection system, it is essential to know the damage potential of the stored beam and the consequences in case of a failure. One (catastrophic) failure would be, if the entire beam is lost in the aperture due to a problem with the beam dumping system. This thesis presents the simulation studies, results of a benchmarking experiment, and detailed target investigation, for this failure case. In the experiment, solid copper cylinders were irradiated with the 440GeV proton beam delivered by the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at the High Radiation to Materials (HiRadMat) facility at CERN. The experiment confirmed the existence of the so-called hydrodynamic tunneling phenomenon for the first time. Detailed numerical simulations for particle-matter interaction with FLUKA, and with the two-dimensional hydrodynamic code, BIG2, were carried out. Excellent agreement was found between the experimental and the simulation results that validate predictions for the 7TeV beam of the LHC. The hydrodynamic tunneling effect is of considerable importance for the design of machine protection systems for accelerators with high stored beam energy. In addition, this thesis presents the first studies of the damage potential with beam parameters of the Future Circular Collider (FCC). To detect beam losses due to fast failures it is essential to have fast beam instrumentation. Diamond based particle detectors are able to detect beam losses within a nanosecond time scale. Specially designed diamond detectors were used in the experiment mentioned above. Their efficiency and response has been studied for the first time over 5 orders of bunch intensity with electrons at the Beam Test Facility (BTF) at INFN, Frascati, Italy. The results of these measurements are discussed in this thesis. Furthermore an overview of the applications of diamond based particle detectors in damage experiments and for LHC operation is presented.},

We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different leveling methods focusing the thesis on the beta star leveling technique. We review the beams offset build--up due to the environmental (i.e. natural ground motion) and mechanical (i.e. moving quadrupole) sources. We quantify the instrumentation requirements for the reliable and reproducible operation with small offsets at the interaction points. Last but not least, we propose a novel method for the beam offset stabilization at the collision point based on the feedback from the luminosity.},

The evolution of single beam lifetime through a given fill is obtained from fits to BCT data and from the combination of luminosity losses and calibrated beam loss to collimation. A breakdown of the single beam lifetime into principle components is performed allowing a quantitative picture of component lifetime evolution during Stable Beams. The situation before and after the octupole polarity change and concomitant increase in chromaticity in August 2012 are compared. The analysis is extended to the luminosity lifetime and an attempt to made to evaluate emittance growth from the luminous region size and luminosity evolution through the fill.},

Important operational aspects like integrated luminosity, space and time structure of interactions etc. are discussed.

In this method, new algorithms have been developed to reduce the effect of coupling and other sources of uncertainty, allowing accurate estimates of the calibration factors. Simulations with known sources of errors indicate that calibration factors can be recovered with an accuracy of 0.7\% rms for arc beam position monitors and an accuracy of 0.4\% rms for interaction region beam position monitors. The calibration factors are also obtained from LHC experimental data and are used to evaluate the effect this calibration has on a quadrupole correction estimated with the action and phase jump method for a interaction region of the LHC.},

	abstract = {The primordial matter of quarks and gluons, which filled our universe just after few micro-seconds of its creation through Big Bang, is expected to be created in the laboratory by colliding nuclei at relativistic energies. The ongoing nuclear collision programs at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are two experimental facilities, where matter in the state of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) can be created and characterized. Heavy quarks, mainly charm and bottom quarks, are considered as novel probes to characterize QGP, and hence the QCD matter. Heavy quark diffusion coefficients play a significant role to understand the properties of QCD matter. Experimental measurements of nuclear suppression factor and elliptic flow are able to constrain the heavy quark diffusion coefficients, which is a key ingredient for the phenomenological study and disentangle different energy loss models. We give a general perspective of heavy quark diffusion coefficient in QGP and discuss its potential as a probe to disentangle different hadronization mechanisms, as well as to probe the initial electromagnetic field produced in non-central collisions. Experimental perspective on future measurements are discussed with special emphasis on heavy-flavors as next generation probes.},

	abstract = {In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), particle physics events are created by colliding high energy proton beams at a number of interaction points around the ring. One of the main performance indicating parameters of the LHC is the luminosity. The luminosity is limited by, amongst other things, the strength of the beam-beam interaction. In this thesis, the effect of the beam-beam interaction on the luminosity performance of the LHC and the proposed High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) is investigated. Results from a number of dedicated, long-range beam-beam separation for two different β∗ optics are identified. This separation defines the minimum operational crossing angle in the LHC. The data from these studies are then compared to simulation of the dynamic aperture and the results are discussed. In addition to studies of the LHC, an analytical approach is derived in order to describe the hourglass effect, which may become a contributing factor in limiting the luminosity performance of the HL-LHC.},

	abstract = {Simulating the full dynamics of a quantum field theory over a wide range of energies requires exceptionally large quantum computing resources. Yet for many observables in particle physics, perturbative techniques are sufficient to accurately model all but a constrained range of energies within the validity of the theory. We demonstrate that effective field theories (EFTs) provide an efficient mechanism to separate the high energy dynamics that is easily calculated by traditional perturbation theory from the dynamics at low energy and show how quantum algorithms can be used to simulate the dynamics of the low energy EFT from first principles. As an explicit example we calculate the expectation values of vacuum-to-vacuum and vacuum-to-one-particle transitions in the presence of a time-ordered product of two Wilson lines in scalar field theory, an object closely related to those arising in EFTs of the Standard Model of particle physics. Calculations are performed using simulations of a quantum computer as well as measurements using the IBMQ Manhattan machine.},

	abstract = {The achromatic telescopic squeezing (ATS) scheme has brought an essential conceptual foundation to the HL-LHC project, making possible a strong and clean (achromatic) reduction of β∗, an important parameter with respect to which several HL-LHC sub-systems were dimensioned (e.g., the 150 mm aperture of the new inner triplet quadrupoles) or justified (crab-cavities for mitigating the geometric luminosity loss factor at low β∗ and subsequent large crossing-angle). The basic mechanics of the scheme is shortly reminded, highlighting as well some of its by-products (Landau damping, long-range beam-beam mitigation with octupoles), and a recent improvement which made possible an early, but still partial, implementation of ATS optics in the LHC for the 2017 and 2018 LHC physics runs. The main focus of the paper will be on the experimental validation of the scheme, via the development of dedicated machine configurations and high-intensity beam tests which took place in Run 2. The paper will conclude on the configuration presently in mind to operate the LHC during its third exploitation period (Run 3), while trying to ensure a smooth enough transition toward the HL-LHC, in terms of optics, beam parameters, and dedicated beam manipulations (β∗-leveling).},

High-energy physics provided a natural domain of application of Machine Learning, profiting from these powerful tools for the advanced analysis of data from particle colliders. However, Machine Learning has been applied to Accelerator Physics only recently, with several laboratories worldwide deploying intense efforts in this domain. At CERN, Machine Learning techniques have been applied to beam dynamics studies related to the Large Hadron Collider and its luminosity upgrade, in domains including beam measurements and machine performance optimization. In this paper, the recent applications of Machine Learning to the analyses of numerical simulations of nonlinear beam dynamics are presented and discussed in detail. The key concept of dynamic aperture provides a number of topics that have been selected to probe Machine Learning. Indeed, the research presented here aims to devise efficient algorithms to identify outliers and to improve the quality of the fitted models expressing the time evolution of the dynamic aperture.},

	abstract = {In response to recommendations in the 2013 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics, a conceptual design effort for an energy upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the so-called high-energy LHC (HE-LHC), was launched as part of the Future Circular Collider study. The HE-LHC machine, which is meant to use 16 T magnet technologies in the existing LHC tunnel, would provide proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 27 TeV (∼2×LHC) with a total stored energy of 1.34 GJ (∼4×LHC) per beam. By adapting the LHC collimation system, a first layout of the HE-LHC’s betatron cleaning insertion was conceived, with the requirement to sustain—for at least 10 seconds—the impact of about 1.86 MW, corresponding to a beam lifetime of 12 minutes, without inducing any magnet quench nor any damage to other accelerator components. In this article, we evaluate the power deposition on the collimation insertion for proton beam operation in the HE-LHC machine at top energy, by means of particle tracking and interaction calculations. The beam loss effects on the warm elements as well as on the superconducting dispersion suppressor magnets are assessed through a three-step simulation approach. In particular, for the proposed future high-energy LHC, we demonstrate the necessity of adding local collimators in the dispersion suppressor, and we uncover the harmful consequences of a potential removal of the beam line “dogleg” in the collimation insertion.},

	abstract = {Electrons lenses produce a high-intensity electron beam and have a variety of applications to circular hadron accelerators. Electron beams of different transverse cross sections and distributions may be designed, depending on the desired application, and they are produced and steered along the orbit of the hadron beam, overlapping with it for typical distances of a few meters before being deflected away and disposed of. Hollow electron beams find applications to high-intensity beam collimation for machines like the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Such devices can be integrated in a collimation system to improve the halo-cleaning performance through an active control of the halo dynamics: the annular distribution of the electrons excites resonantly the beam tails surrounding the beam core, while the core itself remains unperturbed, as ideally it only “sees” the field-free “hole” in the electron distribution. Hollow electron lenses are part of the upgrade baseline of the High-Luminosity project of the LHC (HL-LHC) and will be installed in the machine during a long shutdown in 2025–2027 to mitigate effects from beam losses so to improve the collimation system performance. This paper describes the hollow electron lens project within the HL-LHC collimation upgrade.},

	abstract = {INFN is developing at the LASA lab (Milano, Italy) the High Order (HO) corrector magnets for the High Luminosity-LHC (HL-LHC) project, which will equip the interaction regions. Five prototypes, from skew quadrupole to dodecapole, have been designed and tested at LASA. All the HO correctors are based on a superferric design, which allows a relatively simple, modular, and easy to construct magnet. This modularity has been exploited for an engineering change request. The tradeoff between safe handling, force management during cooldown, powering and protection of the magnet is explained in detail. The design of the coils and the mechanical assembly have been improved to increase the efficiency of the series production. Most of the optimizations are aimed to guarantee both a good integration in the LHC framework (i.e., radiation hardness, easiness of installation, safe operation over years), and compatibility with the series production (i.e., standardization of procedures and components for different magnets, reduction of the number of components, standardization of the quality control systems and acceptance tests). All of the produced magnets will be tested at LASA and then delivered to CERN. The design of the test-bed and the optimization of cryogenic and testing procedures is also described in this paper. Following the completion of the prototyping phase, we report in detail the solutions chosen for the HO correctors and we give a perspective of the series construction in industry and acceptance tests at LASA.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear integrable optics is a recently proposed accelerator lattice design approach which allows to generate an amplitude dependent tune shift which is needed in high brightness accelerators to mitigate fast coherent instabilities. Whereas usually octupoles are used to achieve this task, this concept allows doing so without exciting any resonances, in turn preventing any particle loss. The concept is based around a special magnet design, together with speciﬁc constraints on the optics of the accelerator. To study such a system, the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) was recently constructed and commissioned at Fermilab. For the assessment of the performance of this concept, good knowledge of the optics and the (non-)linear dynamics without the special magnet is of key importance. As such, measurements were conducted in the IOTA ring, using the captured turn-by-turn data by the beam position monitors after excitation to infer quantities such as amplitude detuning and resonance driving terms. In this note, ﬁrst results of these measurements are presented},

Extending the knowledge of errors in individual magnets offers potential improvements of beam control by including this information into optics models and corrections computation. Besides, we also present a technique for denoising and reconstruction of measurements data, based on autoencoder neural networks and linear regression. We investigate the usefulness of supervised machine learning algorithms for beam optics studies in a circular accelerator such as the LHC, for which the presented method has been applied in simulated environment, as well as on experimental data.},

The planned experimental program includes studies of possible signs of the phase transitions and critical phenomena in heavy ion (up to Au) collisions at the center-of-mass energies up to 11 GeV/u. The collider experiment provides optimum conditions for efficient energy scan measurements. Attainment of the required average luminosity of the order of 1027 cm-2·s-1 for such physics experiment faces several accelerator physics and technology challenges. Contrary to high energy colliders, the luminosity of NICA case will be mostly limited by the Laslett tune shift, while the beam-beam tune shift parameter will be negligibly small. Flexible operational procedures for the beam storage and short bunch formation have been developed to provide maximum peak luminosity over wide energy range. Beam cooling is critical to counteract luminosity decay due to intra-beam scattering. NICA collider design addresses these issues and satisfies all the requirements for the colliding beams experiments.},

	abstract = {The High Luminosity LHC Project target is to reach an integrated luminosity of the LHC of 3000 fb−1, corresponding to a factor 10 increase in collisions with respect to the current accelerator. One of the main components is the superconducting quadrupole called MQXF. It is based on Nb3Sn technology and has a 150 mm single aperture with a ﬁeld gradient of 132.6 T/m. The MQXF magnets are currently in preseries production in a joint collaboration between CERN and the US-LHC Accelerator Upgrade Project (AUP). The ﬁrst prototype magnet based on 7-m-long coils (MQXFBP1) was assembled and preloaded in 2019. The testing and disassembly was done in 2020. The coils were equipped with optical Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. Some of the FBG values exhibited strain jumps during preload and their signals were lost during cool-down. The magnet did not reach the nominal current, quenching at 15.15 kA. At the time of writing three MQXFB magnets have been preloaded from which the second prototype is soon to be tested. The objective of this paper is to analyze the mechanical behaviour of MQXFB magnets in the light of current knowledge, thanks to earlier short model experiments, as well as describe in detail the process of assembly and preload. We synthesize the mechanical theory of preload and present new considerations on symmetric/asymmetric bladder-key operations and their eﬀects. An extensive comparison between long and short model magnets is presented. In our analysis and FE modeling we take into account the measured coil sizes that vary over position. We introduce a novel technique that allows preload homogenization over the length of the magnet after preload has been done. We analyze the role of the stainless steel shell and show its mechanical behaviour. Finally, the relevant data at cold is presented and analyzed.},

As a benchmark, we compare simulations and data for a large number of physics fills in the 2018 Pb–Pb run at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), finding excellent agreement for most parameters, both between the simulations and with the measured data. Both codes are then used independently to predict the performance in future heavy-ion operation, with both Pb–Pb and p–Pb collisions, at the LHC and its upgrade, the high-luminosity LHC. The use of two independent codes based on different principles gives increased confidence in the results.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09656},
	abstract = {The beam aperture of a particle accelerator defines the clearance available for the circulating beams and is a parameter of paramount importance for the accelerator performance. At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the knowledge and control of the available aperture is crucial because the nominal proton beams carry an energy of 362 MJ stored in a superconducting environment. Even a tiny fraction of beam losses could quench the superconducting magnets or cause severe material damage. Furthermore, in a circular collider, the performance in terms of peak luminosity depends to a large extent on the aperture of the inner triplet quadrupoles, which are used to focus the beams at the interaction points. In the LHC, this aperture represents the smallest aperture at top-energy with squeezed beams and determines the maximum potential reach of the peak luminosity. Beam-based aperture measurements in these conditions are difficult and challenging. In this paper, we present different methods that have been developed over the years for precise beam-based aperture measurements in the LHC, highlighting applications and results that contributed to boost the operational LHC performance in Run 1 (2010-2013) and Run 2 (2015-2018).},

The setup includes also a system to control with sub-μrad accuracy the angular orientation of the crystal, which is done with a high-precision interferometric system. In order to prevent possible beam-induced instabilities and/or damage of the device components from excessive RF-heating, the electromagnetic (EM) characterization of this device is essential prior to its usage with high-intensity beams. In this article, the longitudinal impedance of the crystal primary collimator is studied extensively and estimations of power loss inside the device are provided for the different beam types planned at the LHC and at its High-Luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). Electromagnetic simulations are performed on a realistic model that includes all the relevant components. The model is described in detail and computational challenges coming from its complexity are discussed. Care is taken to characterize the materials of each relevant sub-component. In particular, the lossy properties of silicon, whose complex permittivity is also evaluated through RF rectangular-cavity perturbation measurements, are taken into account. Numerical results are then compared with dedicated RF measurements performed on a prototype built for the LHC.},

	abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider is designed to collide proton beams with unprecedented energy in order to extend the frontiers of high-energy physics. Particles that have an energy different from the nominal one follow dispersive orbits and, if the energy offset is large enough, could be lost on the cold aperture and cause quenches of superconducting magnets. Therefore, particles with large energy offsets must be removed from the beam by the collimation system. Although the dynamics of such particles is well understood and the efficiency of the momentum cleaning is evaluated in measurements, in the past, there were not general simulations tools available for predicting the efficiency of the collimation system in scenarios where off-momentum particles are involved. In this paper we present a new set of tools to simulate off-momentum losses, the benchmarking of these tools with measurements and the evaluation of off-momentum losses in the future LHC upgrade, the HL-LHC. These new simulation tools are applied for simulating two of the main scenarios where off-momentum particles play an important role in the LHC: particles lost at the start of the energy ramp and simulations of the momentum cleaning at 6.5 TeV energy. In this study, the collimation process during dynamic changes in the machine is simulated, as opposed to previous studies in static conditions. This is the first time that this sort of comparison between different simulation methods and measurements is performed. The results are used to provide a better understanding the dynamics of such particles and, finally, these tools are used to estimate the influence of off-momentum losses in the future High-Luminosity LHC.},

Correcting the emittance coupling is one of the ways to increase photon beam brightness in the operational storage ring. The main source of this effect is betatron coupling, resulting from the skew quadrupolar errors. Tune split and Linear Optics from Closed Orbit (LOCO) techniques are used to measure the betatron coupling. We discuss the measurement result of betatron coupling and its correction in the Indus-2 storage ring using available four power supplies, as the knobs, driving the skew quadrupole windings located on sextupoles. The measured coupling ratio of ∼0.8\% closely matches with the coupling ratio obtained from the LOCO fit model. Based on LOCO correction, the coupling ratio can be reduced to ∼0.4\%, which is limited by the degrees of freedom and not by the field strengths. To achieve a smaller and controlled value of coupling, simulation studies based on the LOCO fit model and using the multi-objective differential evolution algorithm with more skew quadrupole power supplies are performed in Indus-2. With sixteen independent power supplies, the emittance ratio can be reduced to {\textless}0.04\% and the brightness enhances by an order of magnitude. Besides, the optimization method used provides quantitative trade-offs between coupling related parameters such as beam tilt angle, emittance ratio, vertical emittance, and vertical beam size, and desired values can be chosen from the Pareto optimal front.},

	abstract = {Following the recommendation of the European Strategy Group for Particle Physics, the Future Circular Collider (FCC) study was launched by CERN to investigate circular collider designs for a post-LHC era. Among the studied collider designs is a hadron- collider option aiming to collide proton at a center of mass energy of 100 TeV. This hadron collider option (FCC-hh) follows a similar layout as the LHC with two high luminosity experimental insertions, meant to complement each other and two low lumi- nosity experiments. This thesis studies the option of combining these low luminosity experiments with the injection in the FCC-hh. Using a contrary design approach to the combined insertion in the LHC and taking into account the constraint from the injection a layout was developed. The goal when developing the beam optics for the insertion was to achieve the lowest possible beam size in the interaction point to guarantee a high event rate. Furthermore, the impact of magnetic field errors in the magnets of this insertion on the beam stability was studied and are discussed in this thesis. In addition, a possible strategy is then presented which would allow to further increase the event rate},

	abstract = {The ever increasing demands placed upon machine performance have resulted in the need for more comprehensive particle accelerator modeling. Computer simulations are key to the success of particle accelerators. Many aspects of particle accelerators rely on computer modeling at some point, sometimes requiring complex simulation tools and massively parallel supercomputing. Examples include the modeling of beams at extreme intensities and densities (toward the quantum degeneracy limit), and with ultra-fine control (down to the level of individual particles). In the future, adaptively tuned models might also be relied upon to provide beam measurements beyond the resolution of existing diagnostics. Much time and effort has been put into creating accelerator software tools, some of which are highly successful. However, there are also shortcomings such as the general inability of existing software to be easily modified to meet changing simulation needs. In this paper possible mitigating strategies are discussed for issues faced by the accelerator community as it endeavors to produce better and more comprehensive modeling tools. This includes lack of coordination between code developers, lack of standards to make codes portable and/or reusable, lack of documentation, among others.},

	title = {Optics-measurement-based {Beam} {Position} {Monitor} {Calibration}.},
	url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/2701414},
	abstract = {Accurate measurements of the focusing properties of an accelerator are essential for proper operation of a synchrotron, both for the machine protection and for the performance of the experiment. Measurement of linear optics functions based on turn-by-turn measurements has been developed continuously in pursuit of more accurate results. Optics functions that describe the focusing properties of the machine can be obtained from different observables: phase and amplitude of the transverse betatron oscillations and the change of the tune by modulating the current of quadrupoles (K-modulation) . Reconstruction of linear optics using the phase, in combination with K-modulation, have been the main approaches for obtaining the \${\textbackslash}beta\$-function in accelerators all over the world.  Measurements of optics functions based on the amplitude, denoted as from amplitude, have not been used as widely as the other methods since it requires accurate beam-position-monitor (BPM) calibration. BPMs are key elements in accelerator operation, providing essential information about different beam parameters that are directly related to the accelerator performance. BPMs are calibrated before its installation in the accelerator to obtain an accurate conversion from an induced voltage to the centre of charge position. This calibration procedure can only be performed when the accelerator is in a period of non-activity and does not completely reproduce the exact conditions that occur during the machine operation. The studies presented in this thesis have served as improvement of the from amplitude approach, \${\textbackslash}beta{\textasciicircum}\{A\}\$, and they can be summarized in two groups: developing of the uncertainty associated to the \${\textbackslash}beta{\textasciicircum}\{A\}\$-function and mitigation of the BPM calibration factors effects. First, a study of the error-bar associated with the measured A-function is introduced using an analytical formalism that has been contrasted with simulations and experimental results. Second, a study of the BPM calibration factors based on optics measurements has been developed as part of this research. Discrepancies observed during the optics measurements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) between different \${\textbackslash}beta\$-reconstruction approaches, show that the impact of the BPM calibration factors on the optics functions was higher than expected from the design values and tolerances. Measurement of the optics functions allows obtaining extra information on BPM calibration together with its associated uncertainty and resolution. This thesis summarizes the development of two different techniques to compute the BPMs calibration factors based on optics measurements accurately. These approaches have been developed using as a test bench the LHC and the PSB, and it is foreseen to extrapolate them to future accelerators. In case of LHC, the optics developed for computing the calibration factors only allows to accurately calibrate a limited range of BPMs located in the vicinity of the experiments denoted as IRs. The implementation of this approach in LHC and PSB is introduced in this thesis. Together with a summary of the hardware and software upgrades needed for its implementation. In case of LHC, calibration factors have been implemented in different machine configurations, in which the -function can be measured accurately using the three different approaches previously introduced: \${\textbackslash}beta\$, \${\textbackslash}beta{\textasciicircum}\{A\}\$ and K-modulation. In LHC IRs BPMs a systematic deviation of the BPM calibration was observed when reconstructing the \${\textbackslash}beta\$-function using the \${\textbackslash}beta{\textasciicircum}\{A\}\$-method with respect to the results obtained using the approach. By compensating the effect of the calibration factors in the measured \${\textbackslash}beta{\textasciicircum}\{A\}\$-function, the average accuracy of the \${\textbackslash}beta\$-function has improved in a 6\% in Beam 1 and 4\% in Beam 2 with respect to the direct measured A-function. On the other hand, in case of PSB, the validation of the calibration optics has been performed using the nominal optics used during the routine operations. Calibrating the BPMs using an optics-based approach has allowed decreasing the -function error bar, previously computed using the approach, by a factor of three.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses measurements on the stabilization of single bunches with second order chromaticity (Q′′) in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Q′′ introduces an incoherent betatron tune spread which can produce Landau damping of transverse instabilities. Although the resulting stabilizing effect is similar to that provided by Landau octupoles, the underlying beam dynamics are different. Since the tune spread from Q′′ is based on the longitudinal rather than the transverse action of the particles, it will not be affected by the smaller transverse emittance beams of future machines, such as the High Luminosity LHC or the Future Circular Collider, and may hence provide more efficient Landau damping than magnetic octupoles. This study serves as a proof-of-principle experiment to demonstrate Landau damping from detuning with longitudinal action by means of Q′′ in a carefully prepared and well-understood accelerator environment. The agreement between measurements and pyheadtail tracking simulations shows that Q′′ indeed contributes to the beam stability, that the numerical model of the LHC is accurate, and that the involved beam dynamics mechanisms are understood from both the single- and multiparticle effects points of view. The results also serve as a first experimental validation of the recently proposed radio frequency quadrupole for Landau damping., This article appears in the following collection:},

	abstract = {Optics Measurements and Corrections have been of utmost importance for successful operation of the LHC and will continue to be so for the upcoming High-Luminosity upgrade HL-LHC. The optics in the insertion regions in particular are very sensitive to errors in their elements, due to the extremely high beta-functions present.

In this talk basic concepts of local and global corrections are presented and arguments made for the importance of extending these corrections to high-order magnetic field errors to improve beam stability and lifetime.

These procedures are presented in the framework of my PhD-Thesis, in which I am concerned with the mitigation of these errors by utilizing resonance driving terms and investigating the effects from feed-down emerging from the non-zero closed orbit in the insertion regions. Results of my studies of the first half of my PhD are shown and discussed here together with an outlook on the upcoming second half.},

	title = {Software {Quality} {Improvement} in the {OMC} {Team}},
	url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/1697983},
	abstract = {Physicists use self-written software as a tool to fulfill their tasks and often the developed software is used for several years or even decades. If a software product lives for a long time, it has to be changed and adapted to external influences. This implies that the source code has to be read, understood and modified. The same applies to the software of the Optics Measurements and Corrections (OMC) team at CERN. Their task is to track, analyze and correct the beams in the LHC and other accelerators. To solve this task, they revert to a self-written software base with more than 150,000 physical lines of code. The base is subject to continuous changes as well. Their software does its job and is effective, but runs regrettably not efficient because some parts of the source code are in a bad shape and has a low quality. The implementation could be faster and more memory efficient. In addition it is difficult to read and understand the code. Source code files and functions are too big and identifiers do not reveal the intention of the coder and are meaningless or even misleading. Thus it isn't easy to modify and extend the code. However, this is also a common problem in software engineering. The improving of productivity and quality in software development is still a field of research. This thesis is about the improvement of the software quality in the OMC team by adopting several techniques from professional software development. A more professional development environment was created and the quality of the existing software base was improved. Further, the members of the OMC team were sensitized to write directly clean code, to practice pair programming and to review each others source code. To measure software quality, a tailored quality model was defined. Code modifications trigger automatically an analysis tool to create metrics, based on the quality model, and present them in a dashboard. A trend anaylysis of this data will show if future developments will increase the software quality. In case that it becomes worse, appropriate steps can be initiated to refactor the corresponding source code parts. In addition a best practices guide was developed in the course of this thesis, which can be used to improve the software quality in any other team.},

	title = {The {LHC} {Transverse} {Coupled}-{Bunch} {Instability}},
	url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/1451296},
	abstract = {In this thesis, the problem of the transverse coupled-bunch instabilities created by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) beam-coupling impedance, that can possibly limit the machine operation, is addressed thanks to several new theories and tools. A rather complete vision of the problem is proposed here, going from the calculation of the impedances and wake functions of individual machine elements, to the beam dynamics study. Firstly, new results are obtained in the theory of the beam-coupling impedance for an axisymmetric two-dimensional structure, generalizing Zotter's theories, and a new general theory is derived for the impedance of an infinite flat two-dimensional structure. Then, a new approach has been found to compute the wake functions from such analytically obtained beam-coupling impedances, over-coming limitations that could be met with standard discrete Fourier transform procedures. Those results are then used to obtain an impedance and wake function model of the LHC, based on the (resistive-) wall impedances of various contributors (collimators, beam screens and vacuum pipe) and additional estimations of the geometrical impedance contributions. Finally, the existing code HEADTAIL, which is a macroparticle simulation code for beam dynamics studies with wake fields, is improved to make possible the simulation of multibunch trains, and a spectral analysis technique is found to facilitate the analysis of the output given by this code, giving the complex tune shifts of the unstable modes present in a simulation. All those theories and tools are used to obtain new results concerning the LHC transverse coupled-bunch instabilities, demonstrating the rather small impact on coupled-bunch instabilities of the number of bunches in a train when the bunch spacing is fixed, and the existence of coupled-bunch modes with intrabunch motion which are more critical than their single-bunch counterparts. A full verification of the complete procedure (impedance theories, impedance model and simulation code) is also performed by comparing the simulation results with actual measurements in the LHC, giving a very good agreement at injection energy and a correct order of magnitude at 3.5 TeV/c. In the end, several predictions concerning the beam stability at the future 7 TeV/c operation of the machine are performed in the case of 50 ns spacing (1404 bunches), revealing that the coupled-bunch transverse mode coupling instability threshold is far above the ultimate bunch intensity but about 20\% smaller than its single-bunch counterpart. Stability studies with Landau octupoles at their maximum currents reveal that the beam remains stable at nominal intensity with Q' = 2 in both planes, provided the particle transverse distributions are Gaussian. At ultimate intensity with either Q' = 0 or Q' = 2, or at nominal intensity when the chromaticity is zero, the beam happens to be unstable, even with the octupoles at their maximum currents.},

These operators can then be concatenated, following well-defined rules, to obtain a resultant operator that characterizes the entire system. New insight into the origin and possible correction of aberrations is provided. With some effort, it should be possible to produce, by manual calculations, explicit formulas for the third-, fourth-, and fifth-order aberrations of a general optical system including systems without axial symmetry. With the aid of symbolic manipulation computer programs, it should be possible to compute routinely explicit formulas for aberrations of seventh, eighth, and ninth order, and probably beyond.},

Therefore, new opportunities to shape the longitudinal phase space arise. Focus will be put on beam dynamics dominated by nonlinear momentum compaction, in particular the generation of a new bucket type – “α-buckets” – and possible applications. Relation of analytical theory, numerical simulations and experimental data will be presented and discussed. In addition, the current limitation due to the bursting instability at the Metrology Light Source bunches will be investigated.

	abstract = {The optics in the insertion regions of the LHC and its upgrade project the High Luminosity LHC are very sensitive to local magnetic errors, due to the extremely high betafunctions. In collision optics, the non-zero closed orbit in the same region leads to a “feed-down” of high-order errors to lower orders, causing additional effects detrimental to beam lifetime. An extension to the well-established method for correcting these errors by locally suppressing resonance driving terms has been undertaken, not only taking this feeddown into account, but also adding the possibility of utilizing it such that the powering of higher-order correctors will compensate for lower order errors. Existing correction schemes have also operated on the assumption of (anti-)symmetric beta-functions of the optics in the two rings. This assumption can fail for a multitude of reasons, such as inherently asymmetric optics and unevenly distributed errors. In this respect, an extension of this correction scheme has been developed, removing the need for symmetry by operating on the two separate optics of the beams simultaneously. Unlike earlier implementations, the resonance driving terms to be corrected can also be changed flexibly. The mathematical background as well as some implementation details of this new enhancement are presented.},

              Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves
              1
              and in the first imaging of a black hole
              2
              . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

In particular, the knowledge of the global aperture at top energy allows pushing the optics to reduce the colliding beam sizes. The standard method used in the LHC commissioning requires using several low-intensity bunches for one measurement and makes bunches un-usable for other activities. This paper presents first global aperture measurements performed at injection with a new method using the AC dipole. This method consists in exciting large coherent oscillations of the beam without spoiling its emittance. A gentle control of the oscillation amplitude enables re-using the beams for several measurements. These measurements are compared with aperture measurements performed using the standard method based on destructive blow-up of bunches. Possible benefits, for example for optics measurements, at top energy with squeezed optics, are elaborated.},

	url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/895142},
	abstract = {The fractional part of the betatron tune for a circular accelerator can be measured by observing beam oscillations on a position pick-up. In frequency domain the betatron frequency is seen as sidebands on either side of the revolution harmonics. Usually beam signal pulses from the pick-up are very short with respect to the revolution period, resulting in a broadband spectrum. Classical tune measurement systems filter out just one of the betatron sidebands. As a consequence, most of the betatron energy is lost and only a very small fraction remains for further processing. This paper describes a new method, referred to as Direct Diode Detection (3D). It is based on the idea of time stretching beam pulses from the pick-up in order to increase the betatron frequency content in the baseband. The 3D method was recently tested in the CERN SPS and PS, BNL RHIC and FNAL Tevatron machines. Results from all these machines [1, 2, 3, 4] show that this method can increase the betatron signal level by orders of magnitude as compared to classical systems, making it possible to observe tunes with no explicit excitation. Frequency resolution in the order of 10-5 and amplitude sensitivity in the order of 10 nm has been achieved with this very simple hardware.},

This overview outlines the systems measuring the tune, chromaticity and betatron coupling of the LHC beams, referred to in the paper as the transverse diagnostic systems. As manual correction of the parameters may reach its limit with respect to required precision and expected time scales, the LHC is the first proton collider that can be safely and reliably operated only with automatic feedback systems for controlling transverse beam dynamics.

Based on previous studies, it was predicted that the current corrections would not be able to compensate this, thereby leading to a degradation of the dynamic aperture. On the other hand, the separation dipole D1 is expected to have a systematic 𝑏5 component of 6 units to 7 units and its contribution to the resonance driving terms will partly compensate the effect of D2, due to the opposite field strength of the main component. Simulations were performed to address these concerns and to verify the compensation assumption, yet confirmed that the errors could only be partly compensated. In addition, various normal decapole resonance driving terms were examined as correction targets and the dependence of feed-down to amplitude detuning on this choice was discovered.},

The system is entirely written in Java and it is using the Spring framework, an open-source lightweight container for Java platform, taking advantage of dependency injection (DI), aspect oriented programming (AOP) and provided services like transactions or remote access. Additionally, all LSA applications can run in 2-tier mode as well as in 3-tier mode; thus the system joins benefits of 3-tier architecture with ease of development and testability of 2tier applications. Today, the architecture of the system is very stable. Nevertheless, there are still several areas where the current domain model needs to be extended in order to satisfy requirements of LHC operation.},

	abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the largest scientific instruments ever built. Since opening up anew energy frontier for exploration in 2010, it has gathered a global user community of about 9000 scientists working in fundamental particle physics and the physics of hadronic matter at extreme temperature and density. To sustain and extend its discovery potential, the LHC will need a major upgrade in the 2020s. This will increase its instantaneous luminosity (rate of collisions) by a factor of five beyond the original design valueand the integrated luminosity (totalnumber of collisions) by a factor ten. The LHC is already a highly complexand exquisitely optimised machine so this upgrade must be carefully conceived and will require new infrastructures(underground and on surface)and over a decade to implement. The new configuration, known as High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), relies on a number of key innovations that push accelerator technology beyond its present limits. Among these are cutting-edge 11–12Tesla superconducting magnets, compact superconducting cavities for beam rotation with ultra-precise phase control, new technology and physical processes for beam collimation and 100 metre-long high-power superconducting links with negligible energy dissipation, all of which required several years of dedicated R\&D; effort on a global international level. The present document describes the technologies and components that will be used to realise the projectand is intended to serve as the basis for the detailed engineering design of the HL-LHC.},

	abstract = {The successful operation of large scale particle accelerators depends on the precise correction of unavoidable magnetic field or magnet alignment errors present in the machine. During the LHC Run 2, local linear coupling in the interaction regions (IR) was shown to have a significant impact on the beam size, making its proper handling a necessity for Run 3 and the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). A new approach to accurately minimise the local IR linear coupling based on correlated external variables such as the {\textbar}C-{\textbar} had been proposed, which relies on the application of a rigid waist shift in order to create an asymmetry in the IR optics. In this contribution, preliminary corrections from the 2021 beam test and the early 2022 commissioning are presented, as well as first results of the new method’s experimental configuration tests in the LHC Run 3 commissioning.},

FCC-ee, operating at four different energies for precision physics of the Z, W, and Higgs boson and the top quark, represents a significant push in terms of technology and design parameters. Pertinent R\&D; efforts include the RF system, topup injection scheme, optics design for arcs and final focus, effects of beamstrahlung, beam polarization, energy calibration, and power consumption. FCC-hh faces other challenges, such as high-field magnet design, machine protection and effective handling of large synchrotron radiation power in a superconducting machine. All these issues are being addressed by a global FCC collaboration. A parallel design study in China prepares for a similar, but smaller collider, called CepC/SppC.},

Following the experience on the HL-LHC this work explores the implementation of non-linear correctors to minimize the resonance driving terms arising from the errors of the triplet. Dynamic aperture studies are then performed to study the impact of this correction.},

Furthermore, simulations can be used as a tool for the analysis of new concepts. In the context of my summer student project, I did simulations of some non-linear eﬀects in the LHC for comparison with recent measurements at maximal beam energy. I used the LHC model to analyse the dynamic aperture of the LHC with AC dipole, meaning with forced beam oscillations. This gives a deeper understanding of the beam dynamics with AC dipole. As result of these studies, the operation of the AC dipole can be improved. Moreover, I had the opportunity to participate in measurements on the LHC during MD.},

              insertions can have a significant impact on the beam-dynamics of a collider, such as the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). Indeed, correction of sextupole and octupole magnetic errors in LHC experimental insertions has yielded clear operational benefits in recent years. Numerous studies predict, however, that even correction of nonlinearitites up to dodecapole order will be required to ensure successful exploitation of the HL-LHC. It was envisaged during HL-LHC design that compensation of high-order errors would be based upon correction of specific resonances, as determined from magnetic measurements during construction. Experience at the LHC demonstrated that beam-based measurement and correction of the sextupole and octupole errors was an essential complement to this strategy. As such, significant interest also exists regarding the practicality of beam-based observables of multipoles up to dodecapole order. Based on experience during the LHC’s second operational run, the viability of beam-based observables relevant to dodecapole order errors in the experimental insertions of the HL-LHC are assessed and discussed in detail in this paper.},

	abstract = {Magnetic field errors pose a limitation in the performance of synchrotrons, as they excite non-systematic resonances, reduce dynamic aperture and may result in beam loss. Their effect can be compensated assuming knowledge of their location and strength. Established identification procedures are based on orbit response matrices or resonance driving terms. While they sequentially build a field error model for subsequent accelerator sections, a method detecting field errors in parallel could save valuable beam time. We introduce deep Lie map networks, which enable construction of an accelerator model including multipole components for the magnetic field errors by linking charged particle dynamics with machine learning methodology in a data-driven approach. Based on simulated beam-position-monitor readings for the example case of SIS18 at GSI, we demonstrate inference of location and strengths of gradient and sextupole errors for all accelerator sections in parallel. The obtained refined accelerator model may support setup of corrector magnets in operation to allow more precise control over tunes, chromaticities and resonance compensation.},

	title = {Corrections of high-order nonlinearities in the {LHC} and {High}-{Luminosity} {LHC} beam optics},
	abstract = {The impact of high-order nonlinear errors on the performance of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its planned High-Luminosity upgrade, the HL-LHC, has been extensively studied. Particularly, the presence of such errors in the Insertion Regions (IR) has shown significant repercussions due to the high beta-functions and feed-down to lower orders caused by crossing schemes. This thesis aims to explore different methods for effectively addressing these high-order errors, with the ultimate goal of identifying and correcting them to optimize beam optics and enhance machine performance. Simulation studies are employed, using a novel and flexible correction algorithm developed during the course of this PhD research. Various strategies are investigated to improve corrections by targeting Resonance Driving Terms (RDTs) associated with diverse error sources. Notably, the algorithm accounts for the feed-down effects and avoids symmetry assumptions between the counter-circulating particle beams. Special attention is devoted to decapole and dodecapole errors, which have demonstrated detrimental effects on amplitude detuning due to feed-down based on previous measurements in the LHC. The anticipated increase in optics sensitivity to errors in the IRs of the HL-LHC further underscores the importance of addressing these errors. The thesis also investigates the influence of misalignments within the IRs housing the detector experiments of both machine configurations, LHC and HL-LHC, in particular in the final focusing triplets and the nonlinear corrector packages. Correction options are evaluated, focusing on the utilization of the nonlinear corrector packages to address errors in the new separation and recombination dipoles in the HL-LHC, where increased decapole errors had been expected. Experimental studies are conducted to validate the findings. These studies involve replicating the nonlinear errors anticipated in the HL-LHC by powering the correctors in the LHC. Additionally, significant efforts are dedicated to mitigating the feed-down effects arising from decapole and dodecapole field errors in order to minimize amplitude detuning, which plays a crucial role in maintaining optimal beam stability and performance. To address this challenge, novel corrections involving the operational implementation of dodecapole correctors in the IRs have been introduced for the first time. These corrections have demonstrated their efficacy in successfully reducing the undesired feed-down effects. The results of these experiments provide valuable insights into the mitigation of high-order errors and contribute to the overall understanding of beam dynamics in advanced particle accelerators.},
