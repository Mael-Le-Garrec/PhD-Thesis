\section{Resonance Driving Terms}

Decapoles, due to their order, contribute to many RDTs. Indeed, 50 of them can be theoretically 
observed in simulations and measurements. In practice, the contributions of individual RDTs
become indistinguishable as many resonances overlap, making it impossible to isolate certain terms.
Up to a fixed order, some resonances, described in~\cref{appendix:rdts}, are unique to
certain multipoles. Those resonances, provided that they are sufficiently strong and close to the
beam, can be measured via their RDTs.

Of interest to the LHC Operation, is the RDT $f_{1004}$, driving the resonance $1Q_x - 4Q_y$.
It can be seen in the horizontal frequency spectrum at $-4Q_y$ with an amplitude dependence on
$J_y^2$. 
Figure~\cref{fig:decapoles:rdts:tune_diagram} shows a frequency
map~\cite{yannis_papaphilippou_detecting_nodate} of a simulation including decapolar field errors,
where their impact on the beam is easily noticeable. The \todo{red} particles evolving close to the
resonance are affected by it and are subject to large tune shifts. Eventually, those particles are 
lost when their amplitude becomes too large.

    in colour. \todo{change colormap}}
    \label{fig:decapoles:rdts:tune_diagram}
\end{figure}

Measuring turn-by-turn data without using any excitation is not a viable option as amplitudes are
not large enough. Spectral lines are indeed usually impossible to discern from the noise floor, 
making RDTs not measurable.
Measurements are hence taken with an AC-Dipole, introducing quadrupolar-like field errors in the 
linear regime~\cite{carlier_nonlinear_2020} and more complex effects in the non linear regime.
In practice, those effects are neglected. \textit{Forced} RDTs are measured with an
AC-Dipole and treated as \textit{free} as no compensation is applied.

Such forced measurements were taken for the first time in the LHC to observe the $f_{1004}$ RDT
at injection energy. The frequency line of the resonance $1Q_x - 4Q_y$ is seen at $4Q_y$ in the
horizontal spectrum, as shows \cref{fig:decapoles:rdts:spectrum_f1004}.

\begin{figure}[H]

    at $-4Q_y$ with different amplitudes for each correction scheme.}

\end{figure}

Moreover, \cref{fig:decapoles:rdts:spectrum_f1004} shows that the amplitude of this resonance line
decreases upon application of beam-based corrections for $Q'''$. This translates to the amplitude
of the RDT $f_{1004}$, as seen in \cref{fig:decapoles:rdts:f1004_dq3}.

\subsection{\todo{Lower Order Contributions}}

As described in \cref{appendix:transfer_maps}, multipoles can combine to create fields that are seen
as higher orders when considering higher orders of the BCH expansion.
For decapoles, combinations of several sextupoles and sextupoles with octupoles give rise to
decapolar-like fields, as described in
\cref{table:appendix:transfer_maps:bch_resulting_orders_combination}.

This effect was observed in 2022 during Run 3's commissioning. Routine corrections of the non-linear
chromaticity $Q''$ and $Q'''$ were performed, and RDT measurements taken before and after their
correction. As $Q'''$ was corrected, the expectation was that the RDT $f_{1004}$ would also lower
with the reduction of the decapolar strengths $K_5$. However, an increase of the RDT was observed,
as shows \cref{fig:decapoles:f1004_dq2_dq3}.

This increase, unknown then, is attributed to octupoles, combining with sextupoles to create
decapolar-like fields.
