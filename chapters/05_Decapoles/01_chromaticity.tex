\paragraph{Expression}

The full third term of the chromaticity function is highlighted in
\cref{eq:decapoles:chromaticity_highlight}. Details on chromaticity are given
in \cref{subsection:concepts:chromaticity}.

\begin{equation} 
    Q (\delta) = Q_0 + Q' \delta + \frac{1}{2!} Q'' \delta^2 
                     + \colorbox{yellow!50}{$\displaystyle  \frac{1}{3!}  Q''' \delta^3$}
                     + \mathcal{O}(\delta^4).
    \label{eq:decapoles:chromaticity_highlight}
\end{equation}

This third order, mainly contributed to by decapoles, is related to the $\beta$-function, the
dispersion and the strength of the multipole:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \Delta Q_x''' &=  &\frac{1}{4\pi} K_{5} L \beta_x D_x^{3}\\
        \Delta Q_y''' &= -&\frac{1}{4\pi} K_{5} L \beta_x D_x^{3}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Measurements and Corrections}

In order to assess the accuracy of corrections, measurements have to be done to gauge the response
of the decapolar correctors, \textit{MCDs}.
During Run~3's commissioning, measurements and corrections of $Q''$ and $Q'''$ have been made
routine. Those corrections give the opportunity to study the response of the correctors.
\Cref{figure:decapoles:chromaticity:dq3_comparison} shows the chromaticity function measured during
Run~3's commissioning in 2022 with the nominal corrections via FiDeL and beam-based corrections
computed analytically based on top of FiDeL.

    nominal corrections based on the magnetic model and beam-based corrections aimed at correcting
     $Q''$ and $Q'''$.}

\end{figure}

The nominal and corrected $Q'''$ values are shown in
\cref{table:decapoles:chromaticity:dq3_before_after_beam_based}. The shift in $Q'''$ is shown in 
\cref{table:decapoles:chromaticity:dq3_before_after_beam_based_response} for
each beam and axis, and is showing a good agreement between the measurements and simulations.
The slight imbalance can be attributed to higher order effects of the octupole correctors, whose
correction was implemented after that of $Q'''$.

This agreement between the simulations and the measurements indicates that our decapole correctors
function as intended.
%No noticeable cross-talk between magnets or hysteresis have been identified.

\section{\review{Bare Chromaticity}}


% 2022-10-19

Previous studies~\cite{maclean_measurement_2014} have demonstrated that octupole and decapole
correctors were contributing to an observed octupolar discrepancy in the machine via hysteresis and
feed-down. To evaluate the possible effect of decapole correctors on the third order chromaticity
$Q'''$, a measurement was taken with these elements turned off.

\end{figure}

Simulations have been run with MAD-X and PTC including fields errors from normal sextupole to 
decahexapole. The expected $Q'''$ values are presented
in~\cref{table:decapoles:bare_chromaticity:virgin_dq3} and compared to the measured ones along with
the ratio between the two.

         $Q'''_y$ &     $-1.72 \pm 0.02$      &       $-4.27 \pm 0.01$         &  $0.42 \pm 0.01$\\

    \label{table:decapoles:bare_chromaticity:virgin_dq3}
\end{table}

A consistent ratio is observed for every beam and plane between the measurement and the model. This
result, supplemented by the correct response of the correctors, indicates that the decapolar
correctors do no generate unwanted fields. Those correctors can thus be discarded as the potential
source of discrepancy.
