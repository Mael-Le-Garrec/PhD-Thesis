\section{Motivation}

\subsection{Harmonics and Field Errors}

Manufactured magnets never have a single field as one would like. Instead, so called 
\textit{allowed harmonics} exist due to the geometry of the coil. As such, the allowed harmonics of
dipoles are sextupolar, decapolar, decatetrapolar and so on~\cite{deniau_magnetic_2009}.

During the design of the LHC, the main dipoles have been identified to generate a significant 
decapolar field, aimed to be corrected by \textit{MCDs}, decapolar magnet correctors.
Magnetic measurements of those various fields were taken and magnetic tables built.

\subsection{Discrepancies at Injection}

Beam-based measurements have been carried in the LHC since Run 1 to better understand the decapolar
fields. Those have been carried out via chromaticity
measurements~\cite{maclean_non-linear_2011,maclean_commissioning_2016,maclean_measurement_2014}. 
The third order of the non-linear chromaticity, $Q'''$, generated for the most part by decapoles,
has shown a consistent discrepancy at injection energy between its expected value from simulations
and that observed. Figure \ref{fig:decapoles:bare_chroma_vs_simulations} highlights this
discrepancy.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/bare_chroma_simulated.png}
    \caption{Measured and simulated chromaticity at injection energy without octupolar and
             decapolar corrections. \todo{png really?}}
    \label{fig:decapoles:bare_chroma_vs_simulations}
\end{figure}

The operational corrections being based on a magnetic model and simulations, this 
discrepancy should not appear.
It has though indeed been observed that $Q'''$ is over-corrected by an almost factor 2,
resulting in an effectively un-corrected third order chromaticity. The magnetic model, FiDeL, is
used during operation to correct various multipole errors, including octupolar and decapolar.
Chromaticity measurements have thus been repeated during LHC's Run 3 and complemented by beam-based
corrections.

While non-linear chromaticity provides an easy measurement of decapolar fields, it does not permit
alone to understand where the discrepancy originates from. 
New measurements were therefore undertaken to better understand the decapolar fields via observables
never studied before:
\begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item Bare Chromaticity, chromaticity with octupolar and decapolar correctors turned off.
    \item Chromatic Amplitude Detuning, tune shift dependant on both the action and the momentum 
    offset.
    \item Resonance Driving Term $f_{1004}$, contributing to a resonance close the working point.
\end{itemize}
