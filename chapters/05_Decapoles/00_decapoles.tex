\section{Motivation}

The decapole fields in the LHC have been studied since Run 1 via chromaticity 
measurements~\cite{maclean_non-linear_2011,maclean_commissioning_2016,maclean_measurement_2014}. 
The third order of the non-linear chromaticity, $Q'''$, generated for the most part by decapoles,
has shown a consistent discrepancy at injection energy between its expected value in simulation and
that observed in beam-based measurements.
Figure \ref{fig:decapoles:bare_chroma_vs_simulations} highlights this discrepancy.

             decapolar corrections.}
    \label{fig:decapoles:bare_chroma_vs_simulations}
\end{figure}

This discrepancy poses a significant problem, as the operational corrections are derived from
simulations. It is thus observed that $Q'''$ is over-corrected by an almost factor 2, resulting in
an effectively un-corrected third order chromaticity.
Chromaticity measurements have thus been repeated during LHC's Run 3 and complemented by beam-based
corrections.

While non-linear chromaticity provides an easy measurement of decapolar fields, it does not permit
alone to understand where the discrepancy originates from. 
New measurements were therefore undertaken to better understand the decapolar fields via observables
never studied before:
\begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item Bare Chromaticity, chromaticity with octupolar and decapolar correctors turned off.
    \item Chromatic Amplitude Detuning, tune shift dependant on both the action and the momentum 
    offset.
    \item Resonance Driving Term $f_{1004}$, contributing to a resonance close the working point.
\end{itemize}
