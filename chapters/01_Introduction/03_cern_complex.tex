\section{\todo{Particle Accelerators}}

\todo{references}

Particle accelerators are a fairly recent development, driven by the high-energy particle
physics field~\cite{bryant_brief_1994}. The first accelerators, at the beginning of the 20th
century, were able to accelerate particles up to an energies of a few MeV via electric fields.

The Cockroft Walton generator was indeed powerful enough to split for the first time an atom in
1932, less than a 100 years ago. Its design used capacitors and diodes to double the voltage at each
stage, its main limitation being thus the breakdown voltage of the capacitors.
The Van de Graaff generator, created around the same years, was able to accelerate particles up to
tens of MeV in its \textit{Tandem} form. Such particle accelerators are still in use
nowadays~\cite{lebois_rapport_2020}.

Radiofrequency generators with alternating electric fields and drift tubes were thought about
already in the late 30s and are the beginning of the modern accelerator technology.
Rapidly evolving, the accelerator particles went from a few keV in linear accelerators to now TeV in 
circular accelerators, called synchrotrons.

While single beam synchrotrons can be used for fixed target experiments, only a fraction of the
energy is available on impact. Dual beam machines were more suitable for high energy physics
experiments, and the first hadron collider was thus built at CERN in 1971 with an energy of 62GeV,
taking its beam from the Proton Synchrotron (PS). Several colliders have been built in the past and
several are now either in construction or their design being studied.

Particle accelerators still nowadays are rapidly evolving. New acceleration and focusing techniques
are being developed while making the machines smaller. It is an exciting time for all fields that
might benefit from energetic particles, be it fundamental research, medical, industrial or security.

\subsection{\review{The CERN Complex}}

CERN is a large laboratory, located on the border of France and Switzerland, near Geneva. Although
well known for the discoveries in particle physics, studies are also conducted amongst others on
medical applications, biology, radiation hardness or material science.
Several accelerators take place in the accelerator complex, as illustrated in
\cref{fig:introduction:cern_complex}. A large number of fixed target experiments exist, whose
beams are delivered by various accelerators depending on their needs. Those experiments are often
renewed~\footnote{Up to date information can be found on
\href{https://home.cern/science/experiments}{https://home.cern/science/experiments}.}.

The largest part of the CERN accelerator complex is the LHC. The LINAC4, PSB, PS and SPS
accelerators serve as pre-injectors to the LHC in priority from their other experiments.

\subsection{\review{The Large Hadron Collider}}

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), is a circular particle accelerator primarily designed to collide
protons for fundamental particle physics research. It can, occasionally over the year, also collide
ions such as oxygen or lead for specifics studies. At the time of writing, in 2024, it holds several
records, such as being the largest and most powerful accelerator in the world, being near 27km long.
The LHC is composed of two beams pipes, being able to accelerate two particle beams from an
injection energy of $450$GeV to an energy of $6,800$GeV, before colliding them in four detectors:
ATLAS, CMS, Alice and LCHb.

Well publicized, the LHC is often depicted via its superconducting dipole magnets, housed in a blue
cryostat, aimed at cooling the coils. \cref{fig:3d_cut_dipole} shows a 3D cut of such magnets. The
LHC is in majority composed of those \textit{main} dipoles, as it holds $1,232$ of them, being each
about 14 meters long. Superconducting materials like Niobium-Titanium (NbTi) are utilized, as
conventional materials such as copper would melt under the current strain. There are indeed around
$12,000$ amperes supplied to generate the magnetic fields necessary for bending the trajectory of
the particles.
Those particles travel at nearly the speed of light (more precisely, $99.99999905\%$ of it),
effectively going around the tunnel about $11,200$ times per second.

%   Straight Sections and Arcs
\subsubsection{Straight Sections and Arcs}

The LHC is not a perfect circle. It is indeed composed of four \textit{straight} sections, called
the \textit{Interaction Regions} (IPs) where detectors or specific instrumentation are placed. Connecting
those sections, the \textit{arcs} are where the majority of the magnets and their correctors are
located along with some instrument like beam position monitors.
\cref{fig:introduction:lhc_irs} shows the arcs as well as the purpose of each straight section,
housing either specific instrumentation or detectors.

%          Arc Cells
\subsubsection{Arc Cells}

Each arc is made up of 23 cells. Magnets are organized in a standard FoDo structure
(see \ref{section:courant_snyder}), as shows \cref{fig:introduction:lhc_arc_cell}.
\textit{Dipoles} are responsible for bending the trajectory of the particles. Their associated
correctors, the orbit correctors, mitigate any possible drift in path.
\textit{Quadrupoles} are used to control the beam size along the ring. Their effect is focusing in
one plane and defocusing in the other. Their associated correctors control the oscillations of the
beam (see tune, \ref{section:courant_snyder}) and possible field imperfections.
\textit{Sextupoles} correct chromaticity, being a misfocus from quadrupoles due to particles having
a different momentum than the reference particle.
\textit{Octupoles} are used to stabilize the beam by introducing Landau
Damping~\cite{gareyte_landau_1997}. The associated correctors correct higher order chromaticity
effects as well as amplitude dependant tune shifts.
\textit{Decapoles} correctors aim at correcting a even higher chromaticity order.

%            Cycles
\subsubsection{\review{Cycles}}

During the operation of the LHC, the machine goes through several states. Those states of the
machine~\cite{wenniger_lhc_2019} have been defined for specific scenarios.

A common example is the operational cycle of the LHC, shown in \cref{fig:cern_complex:cycle}. The
magnets are first pre-cycled~\cite{bottura_pre-cycles_2010} without any beam circulating, to get
them back to a reproducible state. Their current is then increased to accept particles at the 
injection energy of 450GeV. In order to assess the good working condition of the machine, a probe
bunch of reduced intensity is first injected. The number of bunches and their intensity is then
ramped up to attain the desired scheme needed for collisions. This scheme varies throughout the year
depending on the demands of the experiments. The number of bunches and intensity can also be lowered
to keep the machine safe. A common scheme in 2024 is to inject about 2350 bunches with around
$10^{11}$ particles each for collisions.
Optics measurements, due to their destructive nature, typically use between one and three
\textit{pilot} bunches at a lower intensity of $10^{10}$.

The magnets current is them ramped along with the voltage injected in the RF system, to accelerate
particles to an energy of 6.8TeV. While doing so, the beam is squeezed in a first pass at the
Interaction Points. A second pass is done after the ramp is over, to reach a $\beta* = 30cm$ at the
ATLAS and CMS experiments to achieve a small beam size. Crossing-angles are then introduced to make
the beams colliding.

%   Harmonics and Field Errors
\subsubsection{\review{Magnetic Fields}}

The magnetic fields of the LHC are created via the coils of the magnets. Real-life magnets never
have a single field as one would like. Instead, so called \textit{allowed harmonics} exist due to
the geometry of the coil. As such, the main dipoles of the LHC can exhibit fields similar to
sextupoles, decapoles, decatetrapoles and so on~\cite{deniau_magnetic_2009}. Manufacturing
imperfections also add fields errors outside of the scope of the allowed ones. Dipoles are indeed
found to generate octupolar field errors.

During the design of the LHC, the main dipoles have been identified to generate significant field
errors. Magnetic measurements of those various fields were thus taken and magnetic tables built
based on real-life magnets nowadays installed in the machine. Those magnetic tables, computed for
each LHC configuration by \textit{WISE}~\cite{p_hagen_wise_2006} are used by simulation softwares.
Predictions of field errors and compensating strength for the correctors is computed by the Field
Description for the LHC (\textit{FiDeL}, \cite{noauthor_fidel_2021}). FiDeL is used in the LHC
control system in operation to steer the beams.
