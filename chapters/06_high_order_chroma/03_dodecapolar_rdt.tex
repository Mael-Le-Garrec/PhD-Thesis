During the commissioning of 2024, resonance driving terms measurements were performed by kicking the
beam at various strengths with the AC-Dipole at injection energy. Those measurements were intended
to measure several RDTs with a focus on decapoles.
However, a clear line in the vertical spectrum was observed at $5Q_y$, as shows
\cref{fig:high_orders:spectrum_dodecapole_5qy}. This line is contributed to by dodecapolar fields
(seeÂ \cref{appendic:rdts}) and is proportional to the vertical oscillation amplitude.

To achieve these measurements, the kick strength of the AC-Dipole was set up to $40\%$ of its
maximum, made possible by the newly introduced collimator sequence. The specific excited resonance
of the observed line is the $6Q_y$, related to the RDT $f_{0060}$.
\Cref{fig:high_orders:dodecapolar_f0060} highlights the real part of this RDT and the repeatability
of the measurement at varying kick strengths.
