\subsubsection{\review{Limitations}}

So far, the momentum offset ranges of the 2024 measurements have been restricted in order to allow a 
comparison with the shorter ranges measurements made in 2022. The non-linearity of the chromaticity 
and its higher orders become very noticeable once these large ranges are reached.
\Cref{fig:high_orders:chroma_nominal_correction_full_range} shows an example of such measurement for 
Beam 2, made with the nominal corrections, highlighting the difference between two momentum offset
ranges.

\Cref{tab:high_orders:further:chroma_different_ranges} shows the obtained chromaticity values for
varying ranges. From this table, it can be noted that increasing the range mainly
changes the estimate for $Q^{(5)}_x$.
Measurements over such a wide range are not yet fully understood, as other non-linear effects can
induce a detuning. For example, transverse impedances leads to a defocusing effect whose magnitude
increases with the orbit offset~\cite{antipov_single-collimator_2018,kurtulus_lhc_2022}.
Some other performed measurements with wide ranges in 2024 could not be fitted with a chromaticity
function, despite including higher orders. It is deemed that restricting the ranges is beneficial to
the fit estimates, until further investigation of these effects.

%       Even Higher Orders?
\subsubsection{\review{Higher Orders}}

The fifth measurement in \cref{table:high_orders:dpp_ranges} covered a range of $[-4.0 \cdot
10^{-3}, 4.5 \cdot 10^{-3}]$, which is among the widest ever measured. It is clear from
\cref{fig:high_orders:chroma_after_correction_full_range} that a chromaticity function including the
sixth order provides a better fit to the data. However, no additional observations were made for
this order, and considering the previously mentioned limitations, this measurement may not be
entirely robust. Further studies could address these limitations to more accurately characterize the
decahexapolar fields of the LHC at injection energy.

\subsection{\review{Dodecapoles}}

The measured RDT $f_{0060}$ seems to be on par with the model but it is crucial to note that RDTs
of high-order multipoles are contributed to by the lower orders. Notably here, changes of
chromaticity (linear and non-linear), landau octupoles and amplitude detuning corrections will
affect the RDT $f_{0060}$. Such effects stack up quickly and make an accurate model of the machine
hard to achieve. Regarding the chromaticity, there exists a discrepancy between the measured
$Q^{(4)}$ and the model. Further studies could be aimed at trimming lower order circuits such as
decapolar correctors and observing the impact on both the chromaticity and the RDT. The decay of the
$b_6$ component of the quadrupoles could also play a role.

Since dodecapolar correctors are only located at the IPs, within a dispersion-suppressed zone, they
can only influence the RDTs, not the chromaticity. Without crossing angles, and therefore no
feed-down to amplitude detuning, these correctors could be individually trimmed to observe changes
in lifetime and RDT, which could potentially lead to corrections is deemed useful.
