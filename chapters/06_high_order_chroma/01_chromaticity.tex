\section{\review{Chromaticity}}
\label{section:very_hgih_orders:chromaticity}

As described in \cref{subsection:optics_corrections_chromaticity}, the momentum offset $\delta$ is
related to the RF frequency and the momentum compaction factor. This relation is given as a
simplified form in \cref{eq:very_high_orders:simplified_eq_momentum_compaction}. 
The model $\alpha_c$ for the LHC injection optics is $3.48 \times 10^{-4}$ for beam 1 and $3.47
\times 10^{-4}$ for beam 2. Via this relation, a change of 140Hz of the RF frequency corresponds to
a momentum offset of about $-0.001$.

\begin{equation}
    \delta = -\frac{1}{\alpha_c} \cdot \frac{\Delta f_{RF}}{f_{RF,nominal}}.
    \label{eq:very_high_orders:simplified_eq_momentum_compaction}
\end{equation}

The RF frequency is thus changed to induce a change in momentum-offset. The tune will then vary with
this momentum-offset, as shows the chromaticity function expanded up to the fifth order,

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    Q(\delta) = Q_0 + Q'\delta &+ \frac{1}{2!}Q''\delta^2 + \frac{1}{3!}Q'''\delta^3
                                + \frac{1}{4!}Q^{(4)}\delta^4  + \frac{1}{5!}Q^{(5)}\delta^5
                                + \mathcal{O}(\delta^6).
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:very_high_orders:chromaticity_high_orders}
\end{equation}

%To properly characterize higher orders of the chromaticity function and ensure quality measurements,
%several steps are required. The tune measured during chromaticity scans can exhibit jitter and
%resonance lines may appear, requiring thorough data cleaning to either reject problematic data
%points or reduce error bars. The simplified
%\cref{eq:very_high_orders:simplified_eq_momentum_compaction}, describing $\delta$, has been
%sufficient for reliably measuring up to the third order chromaticity. However, this relation also
%needs verification.

\subsection{\review{First Observation}}

Before focusing on the measurement of higher-order chromaticity such as $Q^{(5)}$, it is essential
to consider the procedural improvements that enable such measurements. Improvements in dynamic
aperture, collimation and signal processing with noise reduction now allow for larger oscillation
amplitudes and enhancements in the precision of measurements across broader amplitude ranges. This
increased resolution facilitates the study of non-linear chromaticity, which has been extended to
include higher-order terms, making it possible to detect contributions from dodecapolar and
decatetrapolar fields.
These developments are particularly interesting because they suggest the possibility of directly
measuring $Q^{(5)}$, an observable previously inaccessible due to narrower momentum offset ranges.


A measurement was performed with the octupolar and decapolar correctors \textit{MCO} and
\textit{MCD} set to their nominal settings. These are aimed at correcting $Q''$ and $Q'''$, as
previously described in \cref{chapter:decapoles}. Results of this initial measurement are shown in
\cref{tab:high_orders:chroma_fidel}. Lower order chromaticities such as $Q'$ and $Q''$ are
consistent with measurements done during the previous Run~\cite{maclean_commissioning_2016}.
The fourth and fifth order chromaticities, $Q^{(4)}$ and $Q^{(5)}$, are primarily expected
to originate from dodecapolar errors in the quadrupoles and decatetrapolar errors in the main
dipoles, respectively, as given by the following expressions:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        &\Delta Q_x^{(4)} =  \frac{1}{4\pi} K_{6} L \beta_x D_x^{4}, 
        &&\Delta Q_x^{(5)} =  \frac{1}{4\pi} K_{7} L \beta_x D_x^{5},&&\\
        %
        &\Delta Q_y^{(4)} = -\frac{1}{4\pi} K_{6} L \beta_x D_x^{4},
        &&\Delta Q_x^{(5)} = -\frac{1}{4\pi} K_{7} L \beta_x D_x^{5}.
    \end{aligned}

  \end{table}

Due to the RF-scan method, the momentum offset crosses zero multiple times during the measurement.
The absence of tune change at these points allows us to conclude that the tune drift throughout
the measurement is negligible. This measurement was conducted after an extended period at
injection energy, where the decay of the sextupolar fields is minimal, causing no significant change
in first-order chromaticity. The fitted curve for the chromaticity function is shown in
\cref{fig:high_orders:chroma_before_correction}, where it is evident that a higher-order polynomial
provides a better fit.

%\label{subsection:q4q5_quality}

%The values measured for $Q^{(4)}$ and $Q^{(5)}$ are similar across the measurements, with
%nominal and beam-based corrections performed with very different lower order chromaticity, and well 
%separated in time.
%This reproducibility with varying configurations gives confidence that the measured values are
%robust. It is to be noted that one exception exists for the first measurement, the horizontal plane
%of beam 2 showed a high correlation between the fourth and fifth order terms, making the fit less
%reliable.

The reduced chi-square for this measurement of 2022 for each fit order is detailed in
\cref{tab:high_orders:chisquare_quality}. While adding terms to the chromaticity function is
beneficial to the fit, it can be seen that the reduced chi-square does not substantially improve 
above the fifth order, indicating that such further orders are not warranted.
%\Cref{chroma_comparison} shows a comparison of the measured chromaticity before and after
%beam-based corrections for the horizontal axis of beam 1.

Given the novelty of measuring such high-order chromaticities, additional configurations were tested
to ensure the consistency of the results. By comparing the fitted chromaticity across different LHC
configurations, potential issues stemming from the machine's specific state on the day of
measurement could be ruled out. Further potential sources contributing to high-order chromaticity,
such as the non-linearities of the momentum compaction factor, dispersion, coupling, or noise, are
discussed in the following sections.




%----------------------------------------
%       Momentum Compaction Factor
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{\review{Momentum Compaction Factor}}
\label{subsubsection:momentum_compaction_factor_studies}

Rather than a constant, the momentum compaction factor can be expressed as an
expansion, as detailed in~\cref{subsection:coordinates_systems:momentum_compaction_factor}.
The first terms are given by the following,

\begin{equation}
    \alpha_c = 
    \underbrace{\alpha_{c,0}}_{1^\text{st} \text{ order}}
    + \underbrace{\alpha_{c,1} \delta}_{2^\text{nd} \text{ order}}
    + \underbrace{\alpha_{c,2} \delta^2}_{3^\text{rd} \text{ order}}.
\end{equation}

The expression for $\delta$ at first and second order then reads,

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \delta &= -\frac{\Delta f_{RF}}{\alpha_{0} f_{RF}} && \Rightarrow \text{Order 1} \\
        \delta &= \frac{- \alpha_{0} f_{RF} + \sqrt{f_{RF} 
            \left(- 4 \Delta f_{RF} \alpha_{1} + \alpha_{0}^{2} f_{RF}\right)}}{2 \alpha_{1} f_{RF}}
            && \Rightarrow \text{Order 2} 
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

%It is assumed that only the first term is relevant as the induced difference in chromaticity is
%negligible as will be demonstrated later on.
The momentum compaction factor is computed using MADX at discrete $\delta$ values and then fitted,
as shown in \cref{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:momentum_compaction_factor}. Its non-linearity is
clearly evident. The effect of this non-linearity on the calculated $\delta$ via the RF frequency is
also presented. Field errors have not been found to have any significant impact on the $\alpha_c$
values.

\end{figure}

It is observed that while clearly depending on higher orders, the momentum compaction factor only
has a small impact on the calculated $\delta$.
\Cref{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:momentum_compaction_factor_chroma_meas} shows a real-life 
measurement, comparing the fit of the chromaticity function with various $\delta$, computed up to
the third order of $\alpha_c$.

    \caption{Fit of the chromaticity function considering several $\alpha_c$ orders.}
    \label{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:momentum_compaction_factor_chroma_meas}
\end{figure}

The fit of the chromaticity function is barely impacted when considering the higher orders of the 
momentum compaction factor. The different orders of the chromaticity are collected
in~\cref{table:decapoles:chromaticity:alpha_c_chroma}.
The higher order terms of $\alpha_c$ can thus be neglected and are not a source of higher
chromaticity orders.

%----------------------------------------
%             Noisy Tune
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{\review{Noise and Spectral Lines}}

Noise lines from the electronics can be observed in the raw data obtained from the BBQ tune system.
Occasionally, when these resonances are strong, their frequency peaks can be mistaken for the actual
tune and subsequently logged by the system. This leads to significant uncertainties in the
measurement, especially when these data points cannot be reliably classified as outliers. An example
of a tune measurement affected by this issue is shown in
\cref{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:noisy_tune}. However, this incorrect tune identification was not
problematic for measurements with narrower momentum offset ranges, as the induced tune shift was
smaller and therefore the tune less likely to overlap with strong noise lines.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/noisy_tune.png}
    \caption{Shift of the tune by variation of the RF. Noise lines can appear in some cases,
    making the tune error bar large or downright unusable.}
    \label{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:noisy_tune}
\end{figure}

A solution to this issue is to use the raw data extracted from the BBQ system. From there, a
spectrogram clearly shows the noise lines, as seen in \cref{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:spectrogram}.
Those lines have been repeatedly identified over several measurements and confirmed to be fixed.
The highest peak in the spectrogram can be reliably identified by removing unwanted resonances,
resulting in a cleaner measurement. It is also important to note that the BBQ system requires the
tune window to be set, which, if overlooked, can lead to erroneous data. By analyzing the raw data,
it is ensured that correct data is used, preventing the measurement from inadvertently capturing
noise.

\subsubsection{\review{Momentum Offset from Orbit}}

The momentum offset $\delta$ can be reconstructed through several methods. One such method,
based on beams's orbit, was previously stored by the LHC's logging services but is not the case
anymore. Reconstructing the momentum offset can introduce uncertainties due to the
non-linearities of both the momentum compaction factor, as discussed earlier, and the dispersion.

To evaluate this, a re-analysis of previous Run~2 measurements was conducted using the RF formula,
with the goal of comparing the resulting non-linear chromaticity values.
\Cref{fig:very_high_orders:bare_chroma_2016} shows the chromaticity measurements for Beam 1 and Beam
2 in both planes, with chromaticity computed via both the orbit-based and RF-based methods. A
numerical comparison is provided in \cref{table:very_high_orders:bare_chroma_2016}.

The lack of discrepancy between the two techniques suggests that the measurements were operating
within the linear regime of the dispersion and momentum compaction factor, and no detuning effects
were present that could have been misinterpreted as a higher-order chromaticity.

\subsection{\review{Further Measurements}}

In order to assess the correctness of the observation of higher chromaticity orders, measurement
repeatability is needed. Two measurements were thus take in 2022, with different configurations
pertaining to the correction of the second and third order chromaticities $Q''$ and $Q'''$. 
The first one used the nominal correction strengths for octupole and decapole corrector magnets,
derived from magnetic measurements, where the second one used beam-based corrections for the same
elements, computed from the previous measurement.
More measurements were taken during 2024's commissioning with new optics for the same reasons, to
minimize the second and third order chromaticities. Three measurements were taken: with nominal
corrections, after having corrected $Q'''$  and then $Q''$. The introduced new optics mainly changed
the powering of the triplets at the IPs and are not expected to have a considerable impact on the
chromaticity. 

\Cref{table:high_orders:dpp_ranges} shows a summary of those measurements with their respective 
achieved momentum offset ranges. While the 2024 measurements achieved greater ranges than the
previous ones, those were restricted during analysis to allow suitable comparisons.

The five previously introduced measurements were performed with very different configurations for
the octupolar and decapolar correctors. \Cref{tab:high_orders:mcdo_values_corr} shows the strengths
applied on every circuit for each correction scheme, in 2022. The correction is called 
\textit{global} as all correctors are trimmed uniformly. The 2024 corrections are similar in order
of magnitude.

A summary of the measured chromaticity orders is given in \cref{fig:high_oders:all_values}.  
The first measurement in the horizontal plane of Beam 2 suffered from low beam intensity and worse
noise, resulting a high correlation between $Q^{(4)}$ and $Q^{(5)}$, is therefore not included. The
last measurement for the vertical plane experienced some tune drift, making the fit impossible and
is therefore not included for both beams.

The consistent identification of fourth and fifth order chromaticity across various configurations
of the LHC, with differing lower order chromaticity and coupling, enhances confidence in their
identification. Previous studies have typically focused on fits limited to the third order. However,
expanding the analysis to include fifth order not only increases the estimate of $Q'''$ but also
enhances the overall fit quality. Accurately measuring third order chromaticity is crucial for its
correction, underscoring the importance of considering higher order terms.

\subsection{\review{Model Estimates}}
\label{sec:nl_chroma_model}

Benchmarking the magnetic model of the LHC is important, in order to gauge its correctness and that
of the error tables in use and address any potential discrepancies. The model of the LHC is based on
MADX and magnetic field error tables~\cite{p_hagen_wise_2006}, containing a seeds for the random
errors. To compute the chromaticity, simulations are run via PTC, with a selection of these field 
errors.

Simulations incorporating various field errors have been conducted to evaluate the contributions of
individual magnet orders and their combinations to fourth and fifth order chromaticity. Field errors
are applied to all magnets, with $b_2$ errors in the main dipoles resulting in a $\beta$-beating of
approximately $10\%$. Coupling is introduced using global knobs to create a $C^-$ value of $0.001$,
which is commonly observed during operation. Normal and skew field errors, ranging from sextupolar
($b_3$) to decahexapolar ($b_8$), are added either individually or in combination to determine which
has the strongest effect.


% ----------------------------------
\paragraph{\review{Fourth Order Chromaticity}}

The results from simulations strongly imply that the dodecapolar errors are the main contributors
to $Q^{(4)}$, as can be seen in \cref{fig:high_orders:beam1_q4_ptc}.
The most notable effect on this chromaticity order is the beta-beating, introducing a very large
spread via the various error seeds.
Comparing the simulation at the top with most errors added, the $b_6$ component alone accounts for
$\approx 70\%$ of it for both axes on each beam.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{images/q4_ptc.pdf}
    \caption{Measured and simulated fourth order chromaticity with different multipole errors. The
    $b_2$ errors, applied on dipoles and quadrupoles, generate beta-beating. Coupling is set to a
    value commonly seen in operation.}
    \label{fig:high_orders:beam1_q4_ptc}
\end{figure}



% ----------------------------------
%\FloatBarrier
\paragraph{\review{Fifth Order Chromaticity}}

It is seen that the the decatetrapolar errors are the main contributors to $Q^{(5)}$, as can be seen
in \cref{fig:high_orders:beam1_q5_ptc}. Fringe fields and skew multipoles have been found to have a
negligible impact. 
Beta-beating and coupling are seen to increase by a small amount the chromaticity, while sextupolar
errors induce a spread with the different seeds. 
Comparing the simulation at the top with most errors added, the $b_7$ component alone accounts for
$\approx 70\%$ of it for both axes on each beam of the fifth order chromaticity.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{images/q5_ptc.pdf}

    value commonly seen in operation.}
    \label{fig:high_orders:beam1_q5_ptc}
\end{figure}


% Decay
It has been noted in the previous chapter about decapoles (see \cref{section:decapoles:decay}) that
the $b_5$ component in the main dipoles was large at injection energy, and could explain most of the
discrepancy between the measurements and simulations.
Such a decay in the main dipoles also exists for the $b_7$ component~\cite{deniau2024private}, and
is shown in \cref{fig:high_orders:b7_decay}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{images/decay_b7.pdf}
    \caption{Measured decay of the integrated decatetrapolar field in LHC's main dipoles at
    injection energy. The fit is shown in black~\cite{deniau2024private} and settles around
    $+0.035$.}
    \label{fig:high_orders:b7_decay}
\end{figure}

Its value is though small and settles around $+0.0351 \pm 0.0007$. The average $b_7$ of the main
dipoles is of $0.32 \pm 0.16$. The decay thus increase that value of only about $11\%$.
Simulations done with that decay taken into account are also present in the previous
\cref{fig:high_orders:beam1_q5_ptc}.

The similar ratios between planes and beams for the fifth order could indicate a systematic error
not modeled.
The large differences observed for the fourth order are not yet explained but the difference between
planes could be linked to a shift induced by the decapolar corrections in the vertical plane. It
indeed seems that the fourth order follows a trend with the third order.
