\section{\review{Introduction}}

Beam-based high order field measurements have been carried out in the LHC since its first
Run~\cite{maclean_non-linear_2011, maclean_commissioning_2016-1}, via
chromaticity studies. Those measurements, made by varying the RF frequency while observing the
resulting tune change, have been performed with a momentum offset of up to $\delta = \pm 2.2 \times
10^{-3}$, which led to the observation of the third order term of the non-linear chromaticity.

During the commissioning of Run~3 in 2022, a new collimator sequence has been introduced, allowing wider
momentum offset measurements, within $\delta \in [-3.2\times 10^{-3},3.7 \times 10^{-3}]$. This
improved setup led to the observation of the fourth and fifth order terms at injection energy.
Those terms, denoted $Q^{(4)}$ and $Q^{(5)}$ respectively in
\cref{eq:very_high_orders:chromaticity_high_orders}, are produced to first order by dodecapoles and
decatetrapoles. Dodecapoles being powered off at injection and decatetrapoles being absent from the
lattice, those fields originate from the field errors of the various magnets installed in the LHC.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    Q(\delta) = Q_0 + Q'\delta &+ \frac{1}{2!}Q''\delta^2 + \frac{1}{3!}Q'''\delta^3
                                + \frac{1}{4!}Q^{(4)}\delta^4  + \frac{1}{5!}Q^{(5)}\delta^5
                                + \mathcal{O}(\delta^6).
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:very_high_orders:chromaticity_high_orders}
\end{equation}

In addition to completing the measurements of high-order fields through chromaticity scans,
turn-by-turn measurements were also conducted. High amplitude kicks indeed made it possible to
observe dodecapolar RDTs in the LHC for the first time.

\section{\todo{Summary}}

A wider momentum offset range, combined with new analysis techniques permitted the observation of
the fourth and fifth order of the chromaticity function for the first time in the LHC. Reproducible
values were measured with different machine configurations.

Simulations show that the observed values do not match well with the LHC non-linear model. A factor
$\approx 1.5$ is observed between measurements and simulations for $Q^{(5)}$, which may point to a
systematic error in the b7 error model.

Correction of the measured higher order chromaticity terms is not possible, due to the lack of
adequate correctors in the LHC. It is nevertheless interesting to characterize the higher order
errors for an effective model and understand the effect a higher order fit has on lower order terms.
Precise measurement of those lower chromaticity terms is required in order to effectively correct
them. Higher order terms have thus to be taken into account.

The current range of momentum offset is deemed sufficient to measure higher order chromaticity.
Attempts will, however, be taken to increase that range and assess if such a wider range can refine
the estimate of $Q^{(4)}$ and $Q^{(5)}$.
