\section{\review{Introduction}}

Beam-based high order field measurements have been carried out in the LHC since its first
Run~\cite{maclean_non-linear_2011, maclean_commissioning_2016-1}, via
chromaticity studies. Those measurements, made by varying the RF frequency while observing the
resulting tune change, have been performed with a momentum offset of up to $\delta = \pm 2.2 \times
10^{-3}$, which led to the observation of the third order term of the non-linear chromaticity.

During the commissioning of Run~3 in 2022, a new collimator sequence has been introduced, allowing wider
momentum offset measurements, within $\delta \in [-3.2\times 10^{-3},3.7 \times 10^{-3}]$. This
improved setup led to the observation of the fourth and fifth order terms at injection energy.
Those terms, denoted $Q^{(4)}$ and $Q^{(5)}$ respectively in
\cref{eq:very_high_orders:chromaticity_high_orders}, are produced to first order by dodecapoles and
decatetrapoles. Dodecapoles being powered off at injection and decatetrapoles being absent from the
lattice, those fields originate from the field errors of the various magnets installed in the LHC.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    Q(\delta) = Q_0 + Q'\delta &+ \frac{1}{2!}Q''\delta^2 + \frac{1}{3!}Q'''\delta^3
                                + \frac{1}{4!}Q^{(4)}\delta^4  + \frac{1}{5!}Q^{(5)}\delta^5
                                + \mathcal{O}(\delta^6).
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:very_high_orders:chromaticity_high_orders}
\end{equation}

In addition to completing the measurements of high-order fields through chromaticity scans,
turn-by-turn measurements were also conducted. High amplitude kicks indeed made it possible to
observe dodecapolar RDTs in the LHC for the first time.

\subsection{\review{Procedure}}
\label{subsection:decapoles:chromaticity:measurement}

As described in \cref{subsection:optics_corrections_chromaticity}, the momentum offset $\delta$ is
related to the RF frequency and the momentum compaction factor. This relation is given as a
simplified form in \cref{eq:very_high_orders:simplified_eq_momentum_compaction}. 
The model $\alpha_c$ for the LHC injection optics is $3.48 \times 10^{-4}$ for beam 1 and $3.47
\times 10^{-4}$ for beam 2.  Via this relation, a change of 140Hz of the RF frequency corresponds to
a momentum offset of about $-0.001$.

\begin{equation}
    \delta = -\frac{1}{\alpha_c} \cdot \frac{\Delta f_{RF}}{f_{RF,nominal}}.
    \label{eq:very_high_orders:simplified_eq_momentum_compaction}
\end{equation}

%The standard measurement procedure is to vary the RF frequency to induce a change in momentum
%offset. Frequency steps of 20Hz are taken roughly every 30 seconds, to allow for a precise tune
%measurement. Once beam losses, registered by the beam loss monitors (BLM), are deemed too high the
%frequency is reverted back to its nominal frequency in larger steps. \cref{rf_scan} shows a typical
%RF scan performed to measure chromaticity.
%
%\begin{figure}[tbh]

%    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/MOPL027_f1-1.pdf}
%    \caption{Observation of the tune dependence on momentum offset, created by a shift of RF frequency.}
%    \label{rf_scan}
%\end{figure}

To properly characterize higher orders of the chromaticity function and ensure quality measurements,
several steps are required. The tune measured during chromaticity scans can exhibit jitter and
resonance lines may appear, requiring thorough data cleaning to either reject problematic data
points or reduce error bars. The simplified
\cref{eq:very_high_orders:simplified_eq_momentum_compaction}, describing $\delta$, has been
sufficient for reliably measuring up to the third order chromaticity. However, this relation also
needs verification.




% ========== Noisy Tune
\subsubsection{\review{Noise and Spectral Lines}}

Noise lines, due to electronics, can be seen in the raw data obtained from the BBQ tune system.
Occasionally, when those resonances are strong, their frequency peak can be mistaken as the tune and
logged as such by the system. This yield large uncertainties in the measurement when data points 
can't properly be classified as outliers. A tune measurement presenting this issue is showed in 
\cref{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:noisy_tune}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/noisy_tune.png}
    \caption{Shift of the tune by variation of the RF. Noise lines can appear in some cases,
    making the tune error bar large or downright unusable.}
    \label{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:noisy_tune}
\end{figure}

A solution to this issue is to use the raw data extracted from the BBQ system. From there, a
spectrogram clearly shows the noise lines, as seen in \cref{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:spectrogram}.
Those lines have been repeatedly identified over several measurements and confirmed to be fixed.
The highest peak of the spectrogram can thus be safely identified by removing those resonances,
yielding a cleaner measurement. It is also to be added that the BBQ requires to set a tune window,
which can be forgotten. By analyzing the raw data, it is ensured that the measurement has usable
data and does not try to measure noise.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{./images/spectrogram.png}
    \caption{Tune spectrogram obtained via BBQ system. Strong resonance lines can be seen above and
    below where the tune really is, causing the wrong frequency peak to be identified as the tune.}
    \label{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:spectrogram}
\end{figure}



% ========== Momentum Compaction Factor
\subsubsection{\review{Momentum Compaction Factor}}
\label{subsubsection:momentum_compaction_factor_studies}

Rather than a constant, the momentum compaction factor can be expressed as an
expansion, as detailed in~\cref{subsection:coordinates_systems:momentum_compaction_factor}.
The first terms are given by the following,

\begin{equation}
    \alpha_c = 
    \underbrace{\alpha_{c,0}}_{1^\text{st} \text{ order}}
    + \underbrace{\alpha_{c,1} \delta}_{2^\text{nd} \text{ order}}
    + \underbrace{\alpha_{c,2} \delta^2}_{3^\text{rd} \text{ order}}.
\end{equation}

The expression for $\delta$ at first and second order then reads,

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \delta &= -\frac{\Delta f_{RF}}{\alpha_{0} f_{RF}} && \Rightarrow \text{Order 1} \\
        \delta &= \frac{- \alpha_{0} f_{RF} + \sqrt{f_{RF} 
            \left(- 4 \Delta f_{RF} \alpha_{1} + \alpha_{0}^{2} f_{RF}\right)}}{2 \alpha_{1} f_{RF}}
            && \Rightarrow \text{Order 2} 
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

It is assumed that only the first term is relevant as the induced difference in chromaticity is
negligible as will be demonstrated later on.
\cref{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:momentum_compaction_factor} shows the non linearity of the momentum
compaction factor and its effect on the calculated $\delta$ via the previous formulas.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/higher_order_momentum_compaction_factor.pdf}
        \caption{Non-linear fit of $\alpha_c$ obtained via an evaluation at discrete $\delta$ in
        MAD-X. The green line represents a constant $\alpha_c = \alpha_{c,0}$.}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}

        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/delta_vs_frf_alpha_c.pdf}

        large RF trims.}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Non linearity of $\alpha_c$ and its effect on the computed $\delta$ via RF trims. The
    simulations are done at injection energy of 450GeV.}
    \label{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:momentum_compaction_factor}
\end{figure}

It is observed that while clearly depending on higher orders, the momentum compaction factor only
has a small impact on the calculated $\delta$.
\cref{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:momentum_compaction_factor_chroma_meas} shows a real-life 
measurement, comparing the fit of the chromaticity function with various $\delta$, computed up to
the third order of $\alpha_c$.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/chroma_function_alpha_c.pdf}
        \caption{Fit of the chromaticity function at the $5^{\text{th}}$ order, considering the
        $\alpha_c$ expansion up to the third order.}

        is barely noticeable.}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Fit of the chromaticity function considering several $\alpha_c$ orders.}
    \label{fig:decapoles:chromaticity:momentum_compaction_factor_chroma_meas}
\end{figure}

The fit of the chromaticity function is barely impacted when considering the higher orders of the 
momentum compaction factor. The different orders of the chromaticity are collected
in~\cref{table:decapoles:chromaticity:alpha_c_chroma}.
The higher order terms of $\alpha_c$ can thus be neglected and are not a source of higher
chromaticity orders.

\subsubsection{\review{Momentum Offset from Orbit}}

During machine operation, the momentum offset, derived from the orbit, used to be logged on the
servers. It was then possible to directly compute the chromaticity that way without having to use
the RF and the momentum compaction factor.
In 2016, measurements of the non-linear chromaticity were performed using the former method.
\cref{fig:very_high_orders:bare_chroma_2016} shows a comparison of the obtained non-linear 
chromaticity from both methods, while \cref{table:very_high_orders:bare_chroma_2016} shows a
numerical comparison. Results being similar, is it deemed that both methods are reliable to measure
the non-linear chromaticity in the LHC.

%        Performed Measurements

\subsection{\review{Measurements}}

In order to assess the correctness of the observation of higher chromaticity orders, measurement
repeatability is needed. Two measurements were thus taken, with different configurations pertaining
to the correction of the second and third order chromaticities $Q''$ and $Q'''$.
The first one used the nominal correction strengths for octupole and decapole corrector magnets,
derived from magnetic measurements, where the second one used beam-based corrections for the same
elements, computed from the previous measurement. 
Those two measurements have a respective momentum-offset range of $[-3.1 \times 10^{-3}, 3.1 \times
10^{-3}]$ and $[-3.2 \times 10^{-3}, 3.7 \times 10^{-3}]$.

In order to stay consistent, the horizontal and vertical tunes were respectively set to $Q_x = 0.28$
and $Q_y = 0.31$ for both measurements. The linear chromaticity $Q'$ is set to a small value of $2$
to avoid large tune shifts throughout the scan.
Both measurements were performed during the LHC's beam commissioning, as part of the measurements
and corrections performed after technical or long shutdowns.


%----------------------------------------
%          Nominal Corrections
\subsubsection{\review{Nominal Corrections}}

For the first measurement, the octupolar and decapolar correctors \textit{MCO} and \textit{MCD} were
set to their nominal settings, aimed at correcting $Q''$ and $Q'''$, as previously described in
\cref{chapter:decapoles}.
Results of this initial measurement are shown in \cref{tab:high_orders:chroma_fidel}. Lower order
chromaticities such as $Q'$ and $Q''$ are consistent with measurements done during the previous 
Run~\cite{maclean_commissioning_2016}.

\begin{table}[!htb]

    \begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
    \toprule

    with nominal corrections.}
    \label{tab:high_orders:chroma_fidel}
  \end{table}

Due to the RF-scan method, the momentum-offset crosses zero several times during the measurement.
Negligible change in tune at this point makes it possible to determine that the tune drift through
the measurement is of no consequence.
This measurement was performed after an extended period at injection energy, where the decay of the
sextupolar fields is small and not causing any change in the first order chromaticity. The fitted
curve for the chromaticity function is shown in \cref{fig:high_orders:chroma_before_correction}. 
It is clear that a higher order polynomial is beneficial to the fit, as discussed further in
\cref{subsection:q4q5_quality}.

%       Beam-Based Corrections
\subsubsection{\todo{Beam-Based Corrections}}

After having corrected the second and third order chromaticities via the octupolar and decapolar
correctors, a second measurement was performed.
A uniform trim on all the correctors of each class was applied for each beam, resulting in a global
correction. A total of four circuits were unavailable for the octupoles, three for beam 1 and one
for beam 2, resulting in larger corrections for beam 1. The corrections are applied on top of the
nominal settings~\cite{maclean_commissioning_2016}.
The applied delta is shown in \cref{tab:high_orders:mcdo_values_corr}.
\cref{fig:high_orders:chroma_after_correction} shows the chromaticity function fitted to the 
measured tune after the beam-based minimization of $Q''$ and $Q'''$, while
\cref{tab:high_order:chroma_table_after} shows the values of that chromaticity fit.

Previous studies of chromaticity in the LHC only considered fits up to the third order.
Including fits up to a fifth order increases the $Q'''$ estimate of both measurements, while 
improving the fit quality. $Q'''$ for beam 1 with only a fit to the third order would have a value
of $-0.38 \times 10^6$ instead of the $-1.02 \times 10^6$ obtained with a fifth order fit. 
Accurately measuring the third order chromaticity is essential in order to correct it.

\subsubsection{\review{Fit Quality}}
\label{subsection:q4q5_quality}

The values measured for $Q^{(4)}$ and $Q^{(5)}$ are similar across the two measurements, with
nominal and beam-based corrections performed with very different lower order chromaticity and
several hours apart.  
This reproducibility with varying configurations gives confidence that the measured values are
robust. It is to be noted that one exception exists, for the horizontal plane of beam 2, where the
measurement with nominal correction settings showed a high correlation between the fourth and fifth
order terms, making the fit less reliable.

The reduced chi-square for the last measurement for each fit order is detailed in
\cref{tab:high_orders:chisquare_quality}. While adding terms to the chromaticity function is
beneficial to the fit, it can be seen that the reduced chi-square does not substantially improve 
above the fifth order, indicating that such further orders are not warranted.
%Figure \ref{chroma_comparison} shows a comparison of the measured chromaticity before and after
%beam-based corrections for the horizontal axis of beam 1.

\subsection{\todo{Model Estimates}}
\label{sec:nl_chroma_model}

The model of the LHC is based on MAD-X and WISE field errors~\cite{p_hagen_wise_2006}, containing
a hundred seeds for the random errors. To compute the chromaticity, simulations are run via PTC,
with various field errors.


%====================
\subsubsection{\review{Decatetrapolar Decay}}

It has been noted in the previous chapter about decapoles (see \cref{section:decapoles:decay}) that
the $b_5$ component in the main dipoles was large at injection energy, and could explain most of the
discrepancy between the measurements and simulations.
Such a decay in the main dipoles also exists for the $b_7$ component~\cite{deniau2024private}, and
is shown in \cref{fig:high_orders:b7_decay}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{images/decay_b7.pdf}
    \caption{Measured decay of the integrated decatetrapolar field in LHC's main dipoles at
    injection energy. The fit is shown in black~\cite{deniau2024private} and settles around
    $+0.035$.}
    \label{fig:high_orders:b7_decay}
\end{figure}

Its value is though small and settles around $+0.0351 \pm 0.0007$. The average $b_7$ of the main
dipoles is of $0.32 \pm 0.16$. The decay thus increase that value of only about $11\%$.
Simulations done with that decay taken into account are detailed next.


% =================================
\subsubsection{\todo{Major contributions}}

Simulations with various field errors have been run to assess the contribution of individual magnet
order and combinations for the fourth and firth order chromaticity. Normal and skew fields errors
ranging from sextupolar ($b_3$) to decahexapolar ($b_8$) are added alone or in combination to
observe which is the strongest. Quadrupolar field errors ($b_2$) introduce beta-beating. Coupling is
introduced via skew quadrupolar correctors.


% ----------------------------------
\paragraph{Fourth Order Chromaticity}

The results from simulations strongly imply that the dodecapolar errors are the main contributors
to $Q^{(4)}$, as can be seen in \cref{fig:high_orders:beam1_q4_ptc}.
Fringe fields have a negligible impact, as do skew multipoles.
The most notable effect on this chromaticity order is the beta-beating, introducing a very large
spread via the various error seeds.
Comparing the simulation at the top with most errors added, the $b_6$ component alone accounts for
$\approx 70\%$ of it for both axes on each beam.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{images/q4_ptc.pdf}
    \caption{Measured and simulated fourth order chromaticity with different multipole errors. The
    $b_2$ errors, applied on dipoles and quadrupoles, generate beta-beating. The measurement with a
    high correlation is not included. Coupling is set to a value commonly seen in operation.}
    \label{fig:high_orders:beam1_q4_ptc}
\end{figure}



% ----------------------------------
\paragraph{Fifth Order Chromaticity}

It is seen that the the decatetrapolar errors are the main contributors to $Q^{(5)}$, as can be seen
in \cref{fig:high_orders:beam1_q5_ptc}. Fringe fields and skew multipoles have been found to have a
negligible impact. 
Beta-beating and coupling are seen to increase by a small amount the chromaticity, while sextupolar
errors induce a spread with the different seeds. 
As for the fourth order, comparing the simulation at the top with most errors added, the $b_7$
component alone accounts for $\approx 70\%$ of it for both axes on each beam of the fifth order
chromaticity.

Simulation results are shown in \cref{tab:high_orders:ptc_values}.
\cref{tab:high_orders:ptc_values_ratios} shows the ratio between the measured and simulated fifth

a factor 2.

\section{\todo{CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK}}

A wider momentum offset range, combined with new analysis techniques permitted the observation of fourth and fifth order chromaticity for the first time in the LHC. Reproducible values were measured with different machine configurations.
Preliminary simulations show that the observed values do not match well with the LHC non-linear model. A factor 2 is observed between beams and planes for $Q^{(5)}$, which may point to a systematic error in the b7 error model.

Correction of the measured higher order chromaticity terms is not possible, due to the lack of adequate
correctors in the LHC. It is nevertheless interesting to characterize the higher order errors for an effective model and understand the effect a higher order fit has on lower order terms.
Precise measurement of those lower chromaticity terms is required in order to effectively correct them. 
Higher order terms have thus to be taken into account.

The current range of momentum offset is deemed sufficient to measure higher order chromaticity. Attempts will, however,
be taken to increase that range and assess if such a wider range can refine the estimate of $Q^{(4)}$ and
$Q^{(5)}$.
