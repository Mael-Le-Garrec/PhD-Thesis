Maël's PhD Thesis
=================

This is my PhD Thesis! Made at CERN between 2021 and 2024, with the Goethe
Universität in Frankfurt.
The thesis is under the name "main.pdf", happy reading!

The document is quite long (200+) pages and a bit convoluted given the level
of control I wanted to have on the document. I didn't use a template, I made
everything myself, and well, with the help of stackoverflow and some
colleagues.

The main .tex document is going to be at the root (here): main.tex.
The next most important .tex file is in chapters/_latex/packages.tex, that's
where all the packages and commands are defined.
A command can be edited to set the output of the document to A4 or B5. The
fonts and spacings are automatically set by macros afterwards.

This was just the "interior" of the document. The cover is made via the files
